<h1 id="itching">Itching</h1>
<p>Scratching an itch hits all of the major requirements for a habit (as per The Power of Habit): you have a cue (itchy feeling), a habit (scratch the sucker), and a reward (temporary relief). Most importantly, you feel a <em>strong craving</em> when you get an itch - you desperately want to scratch and collect the promised feeling of relief, even though you’re making the situation worse (which is irrelevant to your habit-formation processes; see: gambling).</p>
<h1 id="the-right-trigger">The Right Trigger</h1>
<p><strong>Key question</strong>: How did it begin?</p>
<p>What was the cue that triggered this whole action (of binge-eating or web-surfing or sleeping)? That seems to give you terrific leverage. If you can just change that cue, you can change everything that follows.</p>
<p>For example, if you felt very hungry, you might decide to go out and order some junk food. Your intense hunger was your cue for junk food. So, now, you can change what you do on that cue. Maybe eat something you’ve kept ready in the fridge for this moment.</p>
<p>If this works, you don’t have to exert inhuman amounts of willpower to prevent yourself from super-sizing everything when you’re already at the fast food outlet. They’re not going to let you get away - with their aromas and friendly noise and exciting menus. Instead, apply pressure at a point where you have some power - at the source of the waterfall.</p>
<p>Do whatever it takes to shift your mind out of the dangerous cue state. If you’re feeling hungry, munch an apple or whatever to sidle out of “very hungry” (which will trigger “eat tons of junk food”) to “slightly hungry” (which will only demand normal home-cooked food).</p>
<p>So, my prediction is that such a small intervention, if successful, will avert the whole binge session. Let’s test it out.</p>
<h1 id="cravings-for-good">Cravings for Good</h1>
<p>Use your cravings for motivation. Reward yourself with junk food when you do some arduous task (like batch-cooking healthy food). This way you should look forward to (or at least not avoid) these chores.</p>
<h1 id="under-siege-from-junk-food">Under Siege… from Junk Food!</h1>
<p>Your time and your diet are under attack from powerful memes. Junk food wants to take over your diet as much as possible (Domino’s, chaat items, chips). And junk content wants to take over your time and attention (Youtube, blogs, reddit).</p>
<p>Corollary of <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/addiction.html">acceleration</a> of addictiveness: Lots more addiction these days.</p>
<p>It’s not you, it’s the system. The reason why our whole generation is addicted to smartphones or FB or Youtube videos is because these things are way more tempting than anything before, not because we have had a collective failure of character.</p>
<p>Don’t blame yourself too much. It’s not like people in past generations had greater willpower and were easily able to stay not-fat. The foods simply weren’t that cheap or tempting back then (I think). Similarly, it wasn’t like they could just make themselves sit and focus on something for long periods on demand. They just didn’t have TV, blog posts, music, messaging, or videos. All they could do was read books or talk to people. In other words, they had far fewer and far less insistent temptations.</p>
<p>In the face of such powerful memes and such risk of being waylaid (by content or by food), you need to plan ahead. “Planning is a necessary evil. It is a response to risk: the more dangerous an undertaking, the more important it is to plan ahead.” (<a href="http://ep.yimg.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/acl1.txt">PG</a>)</p>
<p>Don’t start a day without a plan - for your time or your diet. Change your plan if something better comes along, but don’t fall into bad ways simply by failing to plan. We need better defenses against such powerful memes. This is just a small start.</p>
<h1 id="endless-entertainment">Endless Entertainment</h1>
<p>Wean yourself off the format of an endless stream of content. Like with Youtube, where you keep clicking some awesome recommended video from the side bar. Or online blogs, where you have at least two more links for every new page you browse. You literally can’t stop.</p>
<p>I’ve had trouble falling asleep at night because the videos seemed so inviting. I wanted to check out just one more video… and before I knew it, the time was 3am.</p>
<p>Instead, go for formats with limited amounts of content. Like one episode of a TV show (though, here too, I’ve been guilty of binge-watching entire seasons) or just one chapter of a book.</p>
<p>So, mediums to avoid: Youtube with recommended videos on the side (maybe watch it in theater mode so that you don’t see those other exciting videos), online blogs (maybe open up a limited number of pages and then turn off the internet), cricket matches (these go on and on; something is always happening).</p>

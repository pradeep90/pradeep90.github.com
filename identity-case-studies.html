<h2 id="case-study-1-laura-isaac-the-knitter">Case study 1: Laura Isaac the Knitter</h2>
<p>Laura embarked on the 10,000 hour journey of deliberate practice in the field of knitting. Yes, that’s apparently a vastly intricate and challenging field that takes people years and decades before they produce master work.</p>
<p>In her TED talk, she explicitly brings up the notion of identity change and how she changed her own identity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I take all of the classes and workshops that I am able to. I read about knitting a lot. Obviously, I practice.</p>
<p>I also try to <strong>immerse</strong> myself in various aspects of knitting culture - meeting with local knitting groups, talking with other designers, and even attending a knitting convention. Yes those exist.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Identity destruction through identity construction this was the main reason that I wanted to explore the pursuit of mastery. This idea fascinates me. This is also the aspect of the project that I am currently struggling with the most. My training was in and my background is as a printmaker. <strong>Very few people know me as a printmaker now. Now I am a knitter.</strong></p>
<p>– <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFVW_bvZ3yw&amp;index=5&amp;list=PL70nHus9ULdewbIouOZ_Tw4PyCkYKJ4z3">Laura Isaac TEDx</a> (bolding mine)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Observation: She kept taking “all of the classes and workshops that I am able to”. So, she kept strengthening the rule that knitting is awesome (and weakening all other rules through neglect).</p>
<p>Observation: She presented herself everywhere as a knitter, not a printmaker.</p>
<p>That means she (and others who met her) would judge her as a knitter, not as a printmaker. Therefore, all the praise or ridicule they heap on her would be based on her knitting, not her printmaking, which is exactly what she needs. All the conversation around her would focus on her knitting thus solidifying her rules about knitting and neglecting all else.</p>
<h2 id="case-study-2-andrew-neimann-in-whiplash">Case study 2: Andrew Neimann in Whiplash</h2>
<p>This has its <a href="./deliberate-practice.html#whiplash---observations">own section</a> in my deliberate practice essay.</p>
<p>Some highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Andrew: “My mother left when I was a baby.”</p>
<p>Fletcher: “So no musicians in the family then?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s all Fletcher sees. Music is the only thing he cares about. Family tragedies can go hang themselves.</p>
<h2 id="case-study-3-full-metal-jacket">Case study 3: Full Metal Jacket</h2>
<p>Just watch the opening scene:</p>

<p>That’s the entire film in 1.5 minutes: losing your old identity (as a civilian) and taking on a new one (as a Marine).</p>
<p>If you needed any more exposition on identity transformation:</p>

<h2 id="case-study-rockstar">Case study: Rockstar</h2>
<p>Note: This is a fictional example. There wasn’t really a person called “Jordan”. However, there seem to be enough people who have lived similar lives that we might gain useful insights from the movie.</p>
<h1 id="resources">Resources</h1>
<p>Daniel Coyle devoted one-third of The Talent Code on identity change or, as he called it, “ignition”.</p>

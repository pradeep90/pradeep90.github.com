<h1 id="idea-debt">Idea Debt</h1>
<p>Check it out: <a href="http://jessicaabel.com/2016/01/27/idea-debt/">Imagining your future projects is holding you back</a>. (h/t PG on twitter)</p>
<p>When you build a to-do list of ideas and keep fantasizing about them, you feel they’re awesome and thus put pressure on yourself to express them as well as they seem in your mind. Which means you won’t work on them at all. The unfulfilled potential of your ideas weighs you down (as Michael Nelsen <a href="http://jessicaabel.com/2016/01/27/idea-debt/#comment-2682">pointed out</a> in the comments).</p>
<p>This is similar to my idea of <a href="./The-Technique-Trap.html">net potential benefits</a>: in our mind, we feel like we’ve got the benefits of an idea or technique even when, in reality, we have achieved nothing. Just <em>knowing</em> about the idea is enough to give us a feeling of productivity (look at all the “lifehack” blogs out there). You don’t have to actually do the hard work of executing it to feel good. Plus, because it’s all in your head, you can amp it up as much as you like. More feels!</p>
<p>The downside, however, is that you don’t get any benefits in real life - you have little motivation to work on your product (you’ve got the rewards as far as your mind is concerned) and even if you try to, your work will pale next to your visions of grandeur. Better don’t let that horrible, inchoate thing ever see the light of day.</p>
<p>PG on grand vision vs harsh reality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another test you can use is: always produce. … As long as you’re producing, you’ll know you’re not merely using the hazy vision of the grand novel you plan to write one day as an opiate. The view of it will be obstructed by the all too palpably flawed one you’re actually writing.</p>
<p>– <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html">How to do What You Love</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How to look at notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The notebook and pen are professional equipment, as it were. Though actually there is something druglike about them, in the sense that their main purpose is to make me feel better. <strong>I hardly ever go back and read stuff I write down in notebooks</strong>. It’s just that if I can’t write things down, worrying about remembering one idea gets in the way of having the next. Pen and paper wick ideas.</p>
<p>– <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/island.html">The Island Test</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How to look at your past list of ideas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>accumulate notes for topics you plan to cover at the bottom of the file; don’t feel obliged to cover any of them;</p>
<p>– <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html">Writing, Briefly</a></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Don’t commit to yourself that you’re going to work on all those ideas that your past self was excited about. You’re not the same person anymore. Do it only if it’s worthy. Don’t promise to pay off your idea “debt”. It’s just a bunch of mental cues lying around, not blueprints for monuments. There’s nothing in there.</p>
<p>Don’t fantasize about those idea stubs in your notes file. They’re not the real thing. The information they have is nowhere near enough to actually make them work, but enough to make you feel they do. Just like with <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ideas.html">ideas for startups</a>, ideas for projects are worthless. The value (and the information and the scarcity power) is in the execution.</p>

            <!-- <center><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/t31.0-8/p600x600/10257116_10202295769100492_2438594605053717342_o.jpg" height="400" width="300" class="sujeet-pic" alt="Sujeet pic" /></center> -->

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I use <code>org-drill</code> in Emacs as my Spaced Repetition system.</p>
<h1 id="principles">Principles</h1>
<p>The Master Principle: Never forget anything important twice. Whenever you forget something, add it.</p>
<p>Add flashcards for <em>concrete</em> details that you forgot. “That guy… what’s his name…” - add it. “That sort of <em>thing</em>…” - add it. No more “thing” or “sort of like a” or “kind of”. Know the precise term. There will be a network of concrete things you have forgotten (or perhaps never really encoded). Add them all.</p>
<p>However, don’t add what you have just learned. Wait till you actually need it and can’t remember it. Trying to predict the future invariably goes wrong - I overvalue the fact in the moment - and I dilute my flashcards with useless facts. Waiting for an actual use means that my flashcards pull their weight and, in turn, I cherish and review them enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Make it a question you need to answer. Pose an actual real-world problem whose solution you have to find, instead of some passive fact whose parts you have to guess (sometimes based on the surrounding words). Ideally, it should be of the form: given a Situation, how do you get the desired Outcome?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: X and Y have happened. How do you make Z happen? :drill:</p>
<p>A: Do [Foo] and [Bar]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This way you are forced to classify the situation and use the resulting cue to retrieve your solution from long-term memory. Otherwise, you would just use the context to merely recognize the solution, which probably still involves retrieving from long-term memory, but doesn’t make you categorize the situation from scratch like in real life. This actually prepares you better for the actual task, which is what you want.</p>
<p>Don’t try to memorize dictionary definitions themselves. Insist on seeing the word used. Otherwise, you’re just reciting empty sounds. For example, “invidious - containing or implying a slight or showing prejudice”. Huh? I’ve failed to define that word three times so far now. It would be far better to test for a usage - “invidious comparisons”.</p>
<h1 id="decision-oriented-thinking">Decision-Oriented Thinking</h1>
<p>Present the decision situation and ask for the correct response. This is how it will be in real life. Example: cue - you want to make a summary of a book chapter; response - make an initial summary.</p>
<h1 id="choose-the-right-cue">Choose the right cue</h1>
<p>Use only the cues you’ll have when you need this memory. No point storing the memory on some different cues - you won’t be able to access them when you need to. For example, if you want to remember what Harry said to Hermione in Chapter 22: The Scientific Method, don’t test yourself on parts of that sentence - you’ll just guess from the context. In real life, all you will think is “what did Harry say to Hermione about informal hypothesis testing?” So, test your memory on this cue.</p>
<h1 id="a-flashcard-represents-the-strength-of-an-association">A Flashcard represents the Strength of an Association</h1>
<p>A flashcard is nothing but a way to present yourself with a cue and test whether you can retrieve the correct memory. So, each flashcard tests for the presence of one particular cue-memory association.</p>
<p>Not just that, each flashcard represents the <em>strength</em> of that association. In general, the flashcards that are scheduled for review soon represent weak associations - ones that you are just about to forget. Flashcards that are scheduled far into the future represent strong associations - ones that you remember very well. So, number of days till review for a flashcard represents the strength of its association.</p>
<p>Corollary: If a flashcard is scheduled soon, it means you don’t know it well.</p>
<p>Corollary: If a flashcard is not scheduled anytime soon, it means you know it well.</p>
<p>This is how a spaced repetition system gives you confidence. It tells you <em>exactly</em> what you know and don’t know. You don’t have to worry about having let any ideas slip through the cracks. The stuff you need to focus on (and <em>only</em> that stuff) is right in front of you.</p>
<h1 id="separate-two-way-associations-avoid-fancy-multi-cloze-flashcards">Separate two-way associations: Avoid fancy multi-cloze flashcards</h1>
<p>Corollary: It’s a mistake to have a flashcard that tests more than one association.</p>
<p>Why? Because then the number of days till review no longer represents the strength of an association! You lose the reassuring properties we saw above.</p>
<p>This means that if I have a clozed flashcard - one where you may be tested on either of two associations with equal chance - and I know one association better than the other, then half of the time during review, I will confidently mark the flashcard as “remembered” and keep pushing it into the future when, in reality, I don’t remember it at all and need to strengthen it.</p>
<p>For example, If I’m asked for the meaning of the word “petulant”, I may be able to tell that it means being “easily irritated or annoyed”. However, if I’m asked for a word to describe someone who is “easily irritated or annoyed”, I may not be able to narrow it down to “petulant”. But the review interval doesn’t pinpoint that weakness. If I was asked for “petulant” the first time, I may give a good answer and thus push the next review date farther into the future, thus making it seem like I <em>know</em> this definition, when I really don’t.</p>
<p>Instead, I should treat them as two separate associations and judge my memory of them individually.</p>
<h1 id="testing-flashcards-strengthens-associations">Testing Flashcards Strengthens Associations</h1>
<p>The review interval for a flashcard represent the strength of its association. Now, we want to remember important things, i.e., maximize the strength of all those associations.</p>
<p>How do we increase the strength of an association? We test ourselves on the cue and make sure to retrieve the correct memory (I’m not fully sure how this actually works). This is what flashcard testing is all about. So, testing yourself on a flashcard <em>strengthens</em> your memory of its association.</p>
<p>And what if we don’t have an association at all in the first place? I think testing yourself using a flashcard can create an association (I used it to memorize the periodic table and the flags of countries). Of course, you need to have a good mental structure that provides unique cues for the different items, otherwise they will all interfere with each other. Names alone usually aren’t unique enough (example: get the atomic number for Scandium vs Strontium). Still, a flashcard can help you <em>create</em> an association.</p>
<p>So, the way to remember important associations that would be to create flashcards for them and test ourselves till their strength (aka review interval) is pretty high. The more important flashcards we have and the higher their review intervals, the better.</p>
<p>We must then aim to maximize both the number of important flashcards and their review intervals. Note that using a spaced repetition system automatically ensures that you maximize review intervals. Each flashcard keeps coming back until you’ve learnt it really well. So, all you have to do to memorize an association is to add its flashcard to your system. Once it’s in, you’ve practically memorized it. Just take care to review your cards regularly.</p>
<p>Aim: Maximize the number of important flashcards.</p>
<h1 id="what-cant-a-flashcard-represent">What can’t a flashcard represent?</h1>
<p>Flashcards sound awesome! Combined with a well-oiled spaced repetition system, flashcards let you crush any “learning” (aka memorization) project.</p>
<p>What’s the catch, then?</p>
<p>Flashcards can’t represent all the possible associations a human mind can have.</p>
<p>It can do words-to-words associations (like “petulant” &lt;-&gt; “easily irritated or annoyed”). It can do picture-to-words associations (like image of New Zealand national flag -&gt; “New Zealand flag”).</p>
<hr />
<p>Note that the human mind automatically extrapolates the pictures you memorize. For example, I memorized flags based on tiny thumbnails I found online. But I can still recognize them when I see examples on TV or other websites.</p>
<p>What’s happening is that my mind didn’t literally store the association &lt;24x24 image&gt; -&gt; “New Zealand”. Instead, it used its still-mysterious-to-me image-categorization capabilities to see that New Zealand’s flag consists of “the Union Jack” in the left corner, four stars to the right of centre, and nothing in the bottom-left quadrant. Those three features suffice to distinguish it from other flags (most notably the Australian one, which is similar but has a big star in the bottom-left quadrant, plus an extra small star in the right). So, when I see a real-life New Zealand flag, I notice “the Union Jack” (by some magic process), the four stars to the right of centre, and the lack of a big star, and instantly categorize it.</p>
<p>This abstraction ability is good, because it means that we can reuse our categories. My flag-recognition skills work just the same for flags in pictures, on TV, or in real life.</p>
<p>However, not all our component categories are explicitly verbal, the way “Union Jack” and “four stars” were. We may have categories that we can only explain by waving our hands. (I’m not fully sure of this. Can all our categories be verbalized?)</p>
<hr />
<p>TODO: Flashcards, as far as I can see, can’t represent situation-to-words, which is what we desperately want. It’s all very well to know that “easily irritated or annoyed” means “petulant”, but when your friend throws a tantrum over not getting a good seat at the movies, do you describe him as “petulant”? Similarly, it’s one thing to know that X and Y.</p>
<h1 id="always-be-categorizing">Always Be Categorizing</h1>
<p>One workaround could be to always be categorizing reality using words. Then, if each association has a unique combination of words as its cue (like “easily irritated or annoyed”), we will always be able to trigger a <em>unique</em> response to any situation. This would involve being able to actually categorize the component words like “irritated” or “easily”.</p>
<p>A problem with that is that words are hardly defined with precision (How little should a irritant be before you call someone “easily” irritated?). Most of us pick up the nuances by looking at exemplars. For example, when did good authors use the word “irritated” and when did they not? Still, let’s assume that our human mind can somehow do this job for basic words.</p>
<p>So, our aim is to keep categorizing reality in more and more abstract ways till we hit upon a category that gives us the properties we want.</p>
<p>This means that we can have a flashcard even for an abstract situation like “easily irritated or annoyed” <em>if</em> we make sure to get the categories “easily”, “irritated”, or “annoyed” for real-life situations. All we need to test is the final leap, from “easily irritated or annoyed” to “petulant”.</p>
<h1 id="essays-force-you-to-categorize">Essays force you to Categorize</h1>
<p>I suspect this is why essay-writing is such a good tool for thinking. You try to describe the situation of interest using some words and see if they lead to any further “insights”, that is, if they trigger any existing associations. If they don’t, you rearrange and abstract them further till you finally do. And so on it goes till you have connected the particular situation with your past knowledge and come up with solutions.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t normal thinking work as well? Because those existing associations will not trigger <em>unless</em> you hit exactly the right cues. You have to rearrange and abstract the low-level cues till you form the key that opens the right locker. And I don’t think you can do that with plain thinking - you lose track of things as you go deeper into thought. Essays help you maintain a trail of thoughts that you can use to backtrack or create new paths.</p>
<p>If essays work really well for thinking, that means that (a) we should be writing essays a lot and (b) we should aim to replicate essay-like thinking in everyday life too.</p>
<h1 id="categorization-is-not-automatic">Categorization is Not Automatic</h1>
<p>Prediction: I suspect that we will find it hard to even <em>describe</em> most events.</p>
<p>They may seem simple to us in our minds, as we experience them like a stream of stimuli passing through, but trying to write it out in <em>words</em> will force us to actually <em>categorize</em> that mess of details. We will be forced to look at the connections between things and build a high-level picture of the whole.</p>
<p>All this to say that categorization is not (always) automatic. We need to be <em>forced</em>, by writing essays or teaching others or talking to a rubber duck, to categorize the raw data we see around us.</p>
<h1 id="trigger-categorization-goggles-on-certain-purposes">Trigger Categorization Goggles on Certain Purposes</h1>
<p>Note that you must have a purpose behind categorization, otherwise you will get stuck describing a simple leaf. Wanting to fix a broken car makes us focus on its engine, tyres, and fuel tank, and ignore its paint, air freshener, and radio songs.</p>
<p>So, your purpose drives your categorization. I think the way this is implemented in our mind is that the cue of a particular purpose (“fix car”) triggers certain other cues (“engine”, “tyre”, etc.), which further trigger other possibilities. So, if you want to remember to look at boundary violations of X, for example, then you must make sure that “do better at X” triggers the thought “check for boundary violations of X”.</p>
<p>If we can do this, then I think we can put on the particular domain-specific goggles, pay attention to the right features, and categorize correctly. Boundary goggles make us see things in terms of property rights, desires, and outcomes. Causal goggles make us see things in terms of causes, effects, and orthogonal variables.</p>
<p>Prediction: We fail to categorize when we fail to remember the relevant goggles.</p>
<p>For example, I fail to notice boundary violations not because I don’t know how, but because I simply don’t remember to do so. If unease about my weight triggered “boundary violations about food”, then I would instantly notice that I’ve been eating out a lot lately and not cooking much.</p>
<p>Of course, you may not know how to categorize something at all, like when to use monad transformers or “dependent types”, because you don’t know how. You can fix that by learning how to do it.</p>
<p>Corollary: Store associations from each purpose to its goggles. Use flashcards.</p>
<p>example: get more of X -&gt; causal goggles (look at the <em>cause</em> of X); profit from Y -&gt; scarcity power goggles (look at supply and demand for Y).</p>
<h1 id="insist-on-exemplars">Insist on Exemplars</h1>
<p>Don’t allow yourself to parrot back a definition. Force yourself to give an exemplar so that you can actually use this concept in real life. For example, I “know” that “opprobrium” means “harsh criticism or censure” - but I don’t know where to apply it! I can’t recall seeing it used (and didn’t bother to write down the example when I first noticed my ignorance).</p>
<h1 id="lessons">Lessons</h1>
<p>If you haven’t tested it, why do you expect to remember it? Only expect to remember those memories that you have <em>tested</em>. Yes, memories with which you have a high emotional or intellectual engagement will probably stay with you. Still doesn’t excuse your general forgetfulness.</p>
<h1 id="mere-definitions-vs-understanding">Mere Definitions vs Understanding</h1>
<p>I just realized that we don’t quite respect memory power anymore. It was an absolute necessity in the pre-literate days, a sign of your intelligence, even. But, now, we feel like it’s an insult to have to memorize things. Only dumb people try to learn things by rote, we feel. The rest of us just “understand” the concepts naturally.</p>
<p>Well, reversed stupidity is not intelligence, as Eliezer <a href>says</a>. Just because many not-very-smart people simply memorize definitions instead of understanding them, doesn’t mean we must never commit anything to memory.</p>
<p>We need to differentiate between remembering mere definitions and refreshing our understanding. My failures with spaced repetition in the past have been when I’ve just tried to drill some definition without actually understanding it. You can make out when I do so because the drill goes on for sentences. The ones I make to test my understanding are brief and to the point.</p>
<p>What would we benefit from memorizing? Well, whatever we forget when we need it.</p>
<h1 id="spaced-repetition-techniques">Spaced Repetition Techniques</h1>
<p>Don’t have too many cloze deletions in one drill.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Use pictures. They form richer, unique cues as compared to words. (h/t <a href="https://fluent-forever.com/create-better-flashcards/">Fluent Forever</a>)</p>
<p>Another recommendation to use images:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My original Anki decks were all words. Now, I lean on images as heavily as possible. I find, at least for my sort of mind, that most of understanding something is learning to visualize and manipulate it mentally.</p>
<p>– <a href="http://rs.io/anki-tips/">Anki Tips: What I Learned Making 10,000 Flashcards</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have more than one flashcard for a word, so you store associations for different cues. For example, differentiate between recognizing and producing a word. You may know what a “matinee idol” means, but when you look at Rajinikanth, do you describe him as one?</p>
<p>Review your flashcards religiously:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, no lazy days. Don’t ever skip a day of anki.</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>I review &gt;100 cards a day, every single day, with essentially no days off.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/2w1mgm/does_anki_really_work/">from users on r/anki</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="stats">Stats</h1>
<p>Measure your speed of recall by Time per Drill. I usually take around 10s per drill. When things are slow, 15s per drill. And when going well, 7s per drill.</p>
<p>Recently, when taking notes from a book, I took around 30 seconds to create one drill. I assume I can create other drills much faster, especially for familiar things that I’ve simply forgotten. Still, using this as the upper bound, if I want to create around 50,000 drills in the next 6 years, then I would need to spend around 420 hours creating the drills. Also, I take a maximum of 15 seconds to review one drill. Assuming that I’ll face each drill around 15 times in my lifetime, that means I will spend a total of 15 x 15 + 30 seconds = around 4 minutes per drill. Let’s even that out to 5 minutes per drill. This matches Gwern’s <a href>estimate</a> of around 5 minutes per drill in a lifetime.</p>
<p>Assume that I will review my scheduled drills everyday, no matter how long it takes. So, now, I just have to budget the time for adding new drills.</p>
<p>If I want to build 50,000 drills in the next 5 years, I would need to add (50000 / (300 * 5)) = 33 drills per day.</p>
<p>If I want to build 20,000 drills in the next 5 years, I would need to add around 13.2 drills per day.</p>
<p>If I want to build 10,000 drills in the next 5 years, I would need to add around 6.6 drills per day.</p>
<p>That last number looks most likely because I’m hitting around 7 drills per day for the last 10 days (August 2015).</p>
<h1 id="anki">Anki</h1>
<p>The format of the Anki “notes” export seems to be: <code>&lt;question&gt; TAB &lt;answer&gt; TAB &lt;tag&gt;</code></p>
<p>Use this to get flashcards from Anki decks online. Download them, import them in Anki, and then export them as text.</p>

<h1 id="ideas-for-the-next-level">Ideas for the Next Level</h1>
<p>Generate all possible scenarios and memorize the correct responses, just like for a multiplication table. Memorize all the design patterns in OOP, for example (not that you’re going to use OOP anytime soon); all the Category Theory laws and their derivations - Category, Functor, Monads, etc.; all the important concepts in Haskell - Lens, Free Monad, whatever.</p>
<p>(I’m not too sure about this one) When you get new insights, add them to your drill stack. Process them a bit when they come about and then push them for another round. This should prevent me from forgetting good ideas.</p>
<h1 id="more-ideas">More Ideas</h1>
<p>Knots</p>
<p>The location, capital, currency and flag of every country in the world</p>
<p>Usage for functions and data structures from languages (like <code>re-search-forward</code> in Elisp or <code>interact</code> in Haskell)</p>
<p>Useful programming techniques (like random-sorting a file with <code>sort -R</code> or using <code>fmap (+3)</code> to handle a <code>Maybe Int</code>). You can get these from books and websites like The Pragmatic Programmer, Refactoring, Learn You a Haskell for Great Good, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I use <code>org-drill</code> in Emacs as my Spaced Repetition system.</p>
<h1 id="principles">Principles</h1>
<p>The Master Principle: Never forget anything important twice. Whenever you forget something, add it.</p>
<p>Add drills for <em>concrete</em> details that you forgot. “That guy… what’s his name…” - add it. “That sort of <em>thing</em>…” - add it. No more “thing” or “sort of like a” or “kind of”. Know the precise term. There will be a network of concrete things you have forgotten (or perhaps never really encoded). Add them all.</p>
<p>Make it a question you need to answer. Pose an actual real-world problem whose solution you have to find, instead of some passive fact whose parts you have to guess (sometimes based on the surrounding words). Ideally, it should be of the form: given a Situation, how do you get the desired Outcome?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: X and Y have happened. How do you make Z happen? :drill:</p>
<p>A: Do [Foo] and [Bar]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly, batch. Creating a drill in the moment when you forget something is inconvenient. Instead, maintain a stack of things you want to remember and process it later.</p>
<h1 id="lessons">Lessons</h1>
<p>If you haven’t tested it, why do you expect to remember it? Only expect to remember those memories that you have <em>tested</em>. Yes, memories with which you have a high emotional or intellectual engagement will probably stay with you. Still doesn’t excuse your general forgetfulness.</p>
<h1 id="spaced-repetition-techniques">Spaced Repetition Techniques</h1>
<p>Don’t have too many cloze deletions in one drill.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<h1 id="ideas-for-the-next-level">Ideas for the Next Level</h1>
<p>Generate all possible scenarios and memorize the correct responses, just like for a multiplication table. Memorize all the design patterns in OOP, for example (not that you’re going to use OOP anytime soon); all the Category Theory laws and their derivations - Category, Functor, Monads, etc.; all the important concepts in Haskell - Lens, Free Monad, whatever.</p>
<p>(I’m not too sure about this one) When you get new insights, add them to your drill stack. Process them a bit when they come about and then push them for another round. This should prevent me from forgetting good ideas.</p>
<h1 id="stats">Stats</h1>
<p>Measure your speed of recall by Time per Drill. I usually take around 10s per drill. When things are slow, 15s per drill. And when going well, 7s per drill.</p>
<p>Recently, when taking notes from a book, I took around 30 seconds to create one drill. I assume I can create other drills much faster, especially for familiar things that I’ve simply forgotten. Still, using this as the upper bound, if I want to create around 50,000 drills in the next 6 years, then I would need to spend around 420 hours creating the drills. Also, I take a maximum of 15 seconds to review one drill. Assuming that I’ll face each drill around 15 times in my lifetime, that means I will spend a total of 15 x 15 + 30 seconds = around 4 minutes per drill. Let’s even that out to 5 minutes per drill. This matches Gwern’s <a href>estimate</a> of around 5 minutes per drill in a lifetime.</p>
<p>Assume that I will review my scheduled drills everyday, no matter how long it takes. So, now, I just have to budget the time for adding new drills.</p>
<p>If I want to build 50,000 drills in the next 5 years, I would need to add (50000 / (300 * 5)) = 33 drills per day.</p>
<p>If I want to build 20,000 drills in the next 5 years, I would need to add around 13.2 drills per day.</p>
<p>If I want to build 10,000 drills in the next 5 years, I would need to add around 6.6 drills per day.</p>
<p>That last number looks most likely because I’m hitting around 7 drills per day for the last 10 days (August 2015).</p>

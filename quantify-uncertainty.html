<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<h1 id="random-thoughts">Random Thoughts</h1>
<p>Observation: I don’t have a “good model” of what’s in the rest of this essay even though I wrote it just yesterday and reorganized it today. Also, I can’t quite recall what the remaining questions or ideas are. Don’t even have a general idea for what they are like.</p>
<p>What happens if I reread them? Ok. I’ve got it. The main ideas are cleanliness of essays, uncertainty about courses, and deliberate practice. Obviously these three labels don’t contain all the details, but they are enough to trigger most of the details I want. I know that when it comes to “deliberate practice” below, I’ve written a hypothesis that says “if your field has a lot of automaton, you won’t need to memorize sequences of actions so much; if your field doesn’t, you will have to memorize sequences of actions yourself”.</p>
<p>So, my main test seems to be whether I can recall the general idea for each part of the essay and use that to recover the details so that I’ve got the whole essay in my mind.</p>
<p>Test: When my ideas on induction were scattered across an essay, I felt like I didn’t have a clean model of it.</p>
<p>When I was summarizing key ideas about induction in a separate section a couple of weeks ago, I felt like I had a pretty good grasp of what was going on. Whenever I wanted to recall something, I could point to it in the new, clean section.</p>
<p>But now when I have forgotten that section, it has started feeling pretty “unclean” to me. Yes, it grew a lot in size, but you have to explain the fact that it seemed pretty clear a while back and now, after I haven’t changed the section at all, it has started to seem “unclean”. So, it’s not just a function of the essay itself. It’s also a function of my mental model about it. [I suspect it’s just a matter of search. How quickly can I locate the solution for a given problem? Ideally, the text would be organized to aid that search, but even if it weren’t, I might still remember where I’d put things.]</p>
<p>Question: Could it be that we remember an <strong>entire</strong> book when we think we understand it really well? Maybe all it takes is a well-designed hierarchy of ideas.</p>
<p>Also, do you need “tests” in order to understand legacy prose (like you do with legacy code)? How else can you confidently change it? (Do you need tests for legacy code?)</p>
<p>What does an index give you? It lets you pick out the part of the textbook (or the part of your mind) that would contain the answer to a question.</p>
<p>If text is pretty well-compressed (i.e., you can’t compress it any more by extracting common functions), then you have no choice but to memorize it all in some efficient manner. Yes, if there is still some repetition of ideas, you can probably compress it further, but there is some point beyond which you can’t usefully compress an essay.</p>
<p>Remember that you can store a “ton” of associations without too much trouble, even if it seems at the outset that you can’t possibly do it. For example, I was able to memorize the elements of the Periodic table, the flags of countries, capitals, etc. without even using any real mnemonic techniques. (I still need to quantify an upper limit on the number of associations we can remember. I would probably put it at our reading speed. You can’t memorize what you haven’t read. (It may be different for images and sounds, but I doubt it.)) Remember how you effortlessly recalled a ton of details from a vignette after just reading it once.</p>
<p>Test: Even now, I can’t remember all the potentially-relevant factors that I first came up with below. There are ten of them, in no specific “order”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Potentially-relevant factors: whether I have a high-level hierarchy of the ideas in the material; whether the lower-level ideas allow me to remember the exact details; whether the material is organized into sections or just laid out haphazardly; the breadth of the hierarchy of ideas; the depth of the hierarchy; whether all the ideas in the material are important to you; whether the organization of the material has been changed recently; whether details have been added recently; whether the material is organized or whether you have to do it yourself; your use cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Test: What would it take for me to remember all of them? How to “order” them?</p>
<p>Recall after reading once:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>recall the high-level ideas; recall the details; breadth; depth; organized or haphazard; all ideas important to you; order changed recently; details changed recently; ideas added recently; use cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got pretty much all of them! I was unsure whether or not I had added “use cases” to my list. So, I can’t check whether I’ve exhausted all my ideas (like I could with a memory palace).</p>
<p>Notice how I remembered a snippet instead of the entire item. That snippet (like “recall the details”) is enough for me to regenerate an acceptable version of the rest (“whether I can recall the details of the lower-level ideas” instead of “whether the lower-level ideas allow me to remember the exact details”). Hmm… I consider the two versions to be pretty much the same.</p>
<h1 id="the-problem-is-duplication">The Problem is Duplication</h1>
<p>I suspect that we check whether some material “makes sense” to us by checking if we can categorize all of it into a single hierarchy. We check whether we can remember all of it by regenerating the hierarchy and its details and checking if we can get back the hierarchy from the details. But note that even both are not sufficient for truly understanding something. For that, you should be able to solve problems given to you (though that should be doable once you can regenerate the details). – Maybe there isn’t just one hierarchy you construct from a book. Maybe there’s a hierarchy for every output variable. In fact, what evidence do you have that there is a “hierarchy” at all?</p>
<p>Potentially-relevant factors: how much duplication there is across the sections (that you can detect); whether there isn’t much duplication, but you still find it messy because you’ve forgotten the structure - basically, you can’t find the relevant factors for your use case; whether you have a restricted set of use cases or whether you keep adding use cases; whether you use one hierarchy for multiple use cases or use different hierarchies; whether you know your use cases or you’re unsure; whether you narrow down the possible relevant factors for your use case or you try to keep it all; whether ideas depend on past ideas so that you can’t understand them without understanding the past ideas; whether you allow yourself to duplicate ideas or otherwise refer to them in multiple places or you force yourself to have one rigid structure (this might be why prose seems harder to refactor - there’s no solid way to refer to other modules (unless they’re published)); whether you specify solutions to problems in isolation or you combine their common context; whether the essay flows (how does this matter to problem-solving? Maybe this helps describe functions); whether the ideas are related (how?) or whether they’re just random lists; whether you want to search for the answer to a question (like “time complexity of F-F max-flow algorithm” - isn’t the hierarchy irrelevant here?) or whether you want to get a full definition (like “write the max-flow algorithm”) or whether you want to recognize a category (“that’s a network flow problem”); whether problems have some parts in common; whether solutions have some parts in common (can that happen even if problems look dissimilar?); whether known categories occur in the text or whether it’s all unknown stuff; am I using the same mental concepts for the same category?;</p>
<p>whether you can recall all of it or not - can you feel something is “unclean” even though you recall every bit of it?; whether you can recall the details but can’t recognize categories or infer properties because, say, you used mnemonics, so it’s inert raw material in your hands; whether I have a high-level hierarchy of the ideas in the material; whether the lower-level ideas allow me to remember the exact details; whether I can categorize sections into “chunks”; whether I can recall sections given the category; whether the material is organized into sections or just laid out haphazardly; the breadth of the hierarchy of ideas; the depth of the hierarchy; whether all the ideas in the material are important to you; whether the organization of the material has been changed recently; whether details have been added recently; whether the material is organized or whether you have to do it yourself; number of categories you already have for that field (CS vs biology) - this might affect the breadth of the hierarchy and the success of your recall; time spent reading the material; whether there are tests for the material that test for regression just like unit tests do for programs and whether the material passes those tests; whether there’s a strong structure for the material that it obeys or doesn’t.</p>
<p>Output variables: whether the material feels “clean” to you - one case when you have compressed it like hell and can recall all of it, another is when you haven’t compressed it optimal but can still recall all of it, and another is when you can’t recall any of it (maybe “clean” just means highly-compressed); how much you recall of the high-level ideas; how much you can recall of the details; time taken to memorize the material; time taken to learn the high-level hierarchy; time taken to store the details based on the lower-level ideas.</p>
<p>Question: What’s the exact problem here? There are multiple sections that deal with the same idea, for example, “perfectionism” or “how to understand something”. The same problem holds when I have multiple books talking about the same problem, like procrastination or memory. Which one am I supposed to use as my idea when I come across a problem? One of them? All of them? Basically, I end up perplexed when faced with a problem because I don’t have one clear solution for it. And when I try to add a new idea, I inevitably end up duplicating existing ideas and exacerbate the above problem. So, I want to remember exactly one idea for a problem and I want to add new ideas without duplicating existing ones. I can probably use the problems as tests for uniqueness. If my new idea can solve a problem better than an existing one, then it can replace it. And if the two ideas don’t overlap completely, I can probably point out the differences and have them deal with separate problems.</p>
<p>That’s the crux of my problem with duplication. There are so many sources of information - classroom lectures, textbooks, personal experience when solving problems - that I don’t know how to reconcile them into unique solutions for problems. Plus, these things keep changing, so I have to update my model over time while still keeping it unique.</p>
<p>What about my essays being messy? Well, part of that is that you’re duplicating ideas across sections. Maybe that’s the entire explanation. As you keep tacking ideas to an already messy book, you end up with a gigantic duplicated mess. But don’t you need a hierarchy? Well, that’s part of keeping things unique. The hierarchy helps you search. But don’t you also need the hierarchy for memorizing large amounts of information? Yes, but only a fool would memorize large items willy-nilly. You would break it into known categories and compose them into other known categories till you have captured the entire material.</p>
<p>The fundamental question is: why have a “book” at all? Why not list each pair of problem and solution separately? Why try to answer multiple questions within one book? Well, many solutions require the same context, the way “quick sort” and “merge sort” rely on the general idea of “sorting” (and of recursive functions). To list each solution independently would mean repeating all of the context each time. So, we aggregate things with common context in order to save space, both in the book and in our mind.</p>
<p>How, then, to organize a book or an essay? Is it in topological order?</p>
<p>Hypothesis: I suspect that I refrain from learning ideas until I know that they have been compressed as much as possible because duplication seems to have been punished for me. And since I feel I haven’t compressed my essays enough, I never get around to memorizing them. And so, when I need to extend them, I just do so haphazardly and they become even messier, and I can never feel like memorizing them. But given that humans can learn associations really easily, I should reconsider that position and learn inefficient representations till I can compress them like hell.</p>
<p>Note that a book is made up of sentences, which are probably just category associations. So, the question is how to organize a bunch of associations.</p>
<p>When won’t you be able to store an association?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The common intestinal parasite Giardia intestinalis (synonyms Giardia lamblia, G. duodenalis) was once considered to be a descendant of a protist lineage that predated the emergence of meiosis and sex.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomonad"></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How many chunks do I, as a non-biologist, see? “The (common intestinal parasite) (Giardia intestinalis) - (synonyms) (Giardia lamblia), (G. duodenalis) - was (once considered to be) a (descendant of) a (protist lineage) that (predated the emergence of) (meiosis) and (sex).”</p>
<p>There are around 11 chunks I see in that one sentence. If I don’t know a term, like “Giardia intestinalis”, then instead of recognizing it with a single mental category, I’ll have to remember the raw sequence of syllables (or mini-words) “Geeard-dia intestin-alis”. So, it’s going to take me longer. That’s not an issue, though. If I want to learn those associations, I’m going to have to create those categories.</p>
<p>The real problem is that if I don’t use the same mental concepts for the same objects, I won’t connect new facts to old facts. The same goes if I don’t realize that a function is just mapping over the values in a dictionary - I’ll be struggling to figure out what its behaviour will be like. That’s another possible reason why I might go blank when faced with a problem. I may not be able to recognize it in a way that lets me recall solutions.</p>
<p>If you learn a new set of relevant factors for a category, store that for the right mental concept (reusing it if it already exists). If you learn of a new property value, check if that property already exists (perhaps using some other relevant factors) and reuse it. Do the same thing for the source category and the target category. Basically, a category is allowed to have more than one set of relevant factors. So, don’t create new categories just because you got a new set of relevant factors (like “lack of partial credit” or “conditioning based on target goal, not improvement” for perfectionism - both are valid).</p>
<p>Hypothesis: Hmm… That may be my breakthrough! I was insisting on a single canonical set of relevant factors for a category and was bewildered by the bunch of different relevant factors that came up across my essays. But there’s no such thing as a canonical set of relevant factors for a category. There could be multiple features that separate the set of positive and negative exemplars. This could be how you reduce duplication. Indirection, motherfucker!</p>
<p>How do deal with causality, though? There may be many variables that are correlated with your target variable, but you want to know which ones you can toggle to change the target. In the above example, both “lack of partial credit” and “conditioning based on target goal, not improvement” boil down to the same thing: not reinforcing improvements because they fall short of your overly-high expectations. You can point them out separately as causal factors and not just correlated factors.</p>
<p>Corollary: That means that you have to simply march ahead through books and papers, storing each association as it comes, without worrying too much about whether you’re duplicating the relevant factors for a category. You can simply store both (if you’re unable to reconcile them). So, don’t slow down on account of “refactoring”. After all, if you know that all those resources are mostly right and that the only problem is they are not unified, then it doesn’t matter which relevant factors you use to categorize a new instance. Use whatever works. What’s more important is that you don’t let those squabbles stop you from storing all the properties of the category. That’s where you will gain the most value.</p>
<p>Test: Learning about RNN - I wanted to get a canonical definition. Wikipedia wouldn’t give me that. A normal ML textbook may not either. So, I never really got a clear idea of RNNs. But now that I know there’s no canonical definition, I can go ahead with whatever resources I can find and merge any duplicate relevant factors on the fly.</p>
<p>What does a “problem” look like? It’s either an instance you need to recognize (like “this is Giardia intestinalis”), a property that you need to infer for a category (“cheetahs can run super-fast”), or a category instance you have to generate (“one way to sort in O(nlogn) time is merge sort”). (And maybe, in some cases, exemplars you need to induce from.)</p>
<p>If you want to recognize a category, you need to have learned some of its sets of relevant factors. You may miss this if you used a different mental concept for some relevant factors. You may also miss this if you didn’t induce a set of relevant factors from multiple sources. If you want to infer a category property, you need to have recognized the category correctly (based on the verbal description like “Giardia intestinalis”), recognized the property (“they absorb their nutrients from?”), and finally need to have inferred based on your association. You may miss any of those steps, again if you didn’t use the same mental concept consistently or if you didn’t store the associations. I won’t say much about instance generation.</p>
<p>Start with a positive exemplar and eliminate the factors above. Answer one simple question at a time.</p>
<h1 id="questions">Questions</h1>
<p>To figure out necessary causes, start from a positive exemplar and toggle variables.</p>
<p>How far are my essays from being “clean”? Is it simply the lack of tests? Or will an index do the trick? What’s the difference between “clean” material like books or published articles and my own essay drafts? What’s the output variable here? What would be the differences among an essay with an index, an essay with “tests” (whatever that means), an essay with both, and an essay that I consider “clean”? Is it that the whole essay needs to flow from start to end? Test this factor against positive exemplars. What questions does my essay need to answer? What questions does my model of the course need to answer? Is it in my head? Is it that I consider something “clean” if I have a good model of it?</p>
<p>How to quantify my uncertainty about the stuff taught in a course so far? Basically, how do I distinguish between “don’t understand some of the concepts yet” and “don’t understand anything at all”? Is it just the number of questions I can’t answer? Something like the number of branches not yet implemented for a function?</p>
<p>How much work will it take me to get up to scratch?</p>
<p>How many categories and property associations do I make from the chapters and lectures so far? What is the category feedback? How many different forms of category feedback do I need to consider? What are tentative lower and upper bounds on the number of associations needed to answer questions on the exam? What if you created an index for PL, including points you haven’t studied? Would that help? What’s your output category feedback? How many associations per class and thus how many in total? What do nested or deeper categories look like? How many categories tested in the homework?</p>
<p>Finally, how much of my daily work is induction and category recognition and how much is executing a sequence of actions? How much is searching for an instance?</p>
<p>Is it that you need a sequence only when you don’t have a button that regenerates a stored instance? What about procedures like adding two numbers? Basically, you have to execute the function definition by hand. Think about it: if it’s a skill, that means you’ve done it or something similar before. So you’re literally repeating your actions.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: If it’s a field without much automation, you’ll have to learn sequences of actions a lot.</p>
<p>If it’s a field with a lot of automation, you won’t have to learn sequences because you can save them and refer to them by labels. So you’ll spend most of your time Inducing and recognising categories and saving new definitions.</p>
<p>Also, what exactly is “deliberate practice”? What exactly happens? Why do I notice relevant factors more after half an hour of practice? Attention because of cue followed by reinforcement? Ask a pointed question.</p>

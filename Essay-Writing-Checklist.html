          <h1 id="post-title">Essay-Writing Checklist</h1>

<h1 id="specify">Specify</h1>
<p>Explain each idea in simple words, no matter how obvious you think it is.</p>
<p>Use each idea 25 times to make sure you <em>actually</em> understand it, especially when you don’t want to.</p>
<p>Write concretely, like the singer Gaana Baala. Don’t just say “going up a fragile tree”, say “going up a drumsticks tree that will break if you climb it”. People in oral cultures seem to think too concretely; they apparently have trouble thinking in terms of abstract concepts. I fear that people who read a lot may have the opposite problem. We have our heads way up in the clouds, when we should be down on earth examining concrete specimens. PG is on to something here with all his everyday analogies. You never feel he’s writing for a niche audience - anybody can understand what he’s saying.</p>
<p>Have tons of concrete examples backing up each point. If you want to say, for example, that the scientific method is better than other techniques, <em>show</em> how it is better. Give real-world examples of it kicking ass.</p>
<p>Treat your essay like a hypothesis, not a position you have to defend. Don’t try to convince the reader about how epic awesome these ideas are. If those ideas really are powerful, it will show in the problems they can help you solve. If it doesn’t show, they’re probably duds - why waste time trying to oversell them?</p>
<p>Start from the evidence. This will jog your memory because you will be looking for concrete instances (particular books or blog posts) instead of abstract models (“locality of causality”). Plus, you can use those sources to verify your ideas. Then, once you’ve got all the raw material out there, you can shape it into a beautiful model that is probably better than the vague one you have in your head.</p>
<h1 id="surprise">Surprise</h1>
<p>What question am I trying to answer? More importantly, what is surprising about my answer? Maybe make sure every paragraph or two has some surprising twist, a la PG. This is not just for writing style. If you think the conventional hypothesis is good enough, why are you writing an essay? Show exactly how your hypothesis predicts differently.</p>
<p>Fail Faster! Remember, it’s ok to be wrong. In fact, it’s great! It means you’re getting more Predictive Power. You want to be wrong as soon as possible. So, stick your neck out. Make narrow, bold predictions.</p>
<h1 id="organize">Organize</h1>
<p>Have a clear flow of ideas from start to finish. Condense the information so that it is easy to grasp. Turn it into a Gem. Have a few small chunks to represent complex ideas (“Make something users want”).</p>
<p>Compress each section and make that the lead or the ending. Aim for four high-level chunks.</p>
<p>When in doubt, summarize your essay so far. List all the surprises you’ve found so far. Then shape the essay till you have a clear logical chain through those surprises.</p>
<p>When I write in my journal, I summarize after a few pages of notes. This forces me to clean things up and get even more ideas. I don’t do that for essays. I just add the first draft of a section and leave it there, making the essay harder to read for me the next time around. So, summarize and rewrite each section before you move on from it.</p>
<h1 id="motivate">Motivate</h1>
<p>All this surprising stuff is fine. But why does it <em>matter</em>? What decision will I change because of the questions I’ve answered?</p>
<h1 id="style">Style</h1>
<p>Clear and simple writing: Read it out loud.</p>
<p>Read sentences out loud to see what parts are awkward and contrived. Maybe use the <code>diction</code> and <code>style</code> shell utilities.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t be able to hide poor ideas behind decorative elements. No lists, no <strong>bold words</strong> (sigh), no All-Capitalized Awesome Phrases, and no <em>italicized</em> words. Let your idea speak for itself.</p>
<p>I think a lot of PG’s brevity and punch comes from his use of anaphora. He writes English the way programmers write code - by removing all unnecessary duplication.</p>
<p>Quick example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You probably need about the amount you need to go running. I’m often reluctant to go running, but <strong>once I do</strong>, I enjoy it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Do something hard enough to stretch you, but only just, especially at first. If you’re deciding between two projects, choose whichever seems most fun. If one blows up in your face, start another. Repeat till, like an internal combustion engine, the process becomes self-sustaining, and each project generates the next one. (This could take years.)</p>
<p>– PG, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html">What You’ll Wish You’d Known</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He doesn’t say “but once I go running again” or “but once I try to get out”. He just says “but once I do”, which seems so much smaller and sweeter than the previous two. I suppose it’s because small chunks fit easily within our working memory. Similarly for “hard enough to stretch, but only just” - he leaves out the pointless “but only just hard enough to stretch you” and ends on a strong note. Again with “If one blows up in your face, start another.” Look at how short that second branch is: “start another” - that’s all. Not even “start another one”. Just “start another”.</p>
<p>I don’t fully understand this and I’m sure people have already analyzed this before. Anyway, that’s the level I need to aspire to.</p>
<h1 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h1>
<p>URLs are case-sensitive - didn’t know that! A link with caps works but not the lowercase version: <a href="./Spaced-Repetition-My-Principles.html" class="uri">./Spaced-Repetition-My-Principles.html</a> vs <a href="./spaced-repetition-my-principles.html" class="uri">./spaced-repetition-my-principles.html</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll need to make all my URLs lowercase now.</p>
<h2 id="pandoc-and-mathjax">Pandoc and MathJax</h2>
<p>MathML apparently works in HTML (in Firefox and Chrome) without my having to include the MathJax script.</p>
<p>Key idea: Look at the HTML output of your markdown file.</p>
<p>Pandoc transforms my AsciiMath stuff to poor MathML. I think that’s because it treats the stuff as TEX (<a href="http://pandoc.org/README.html#math">User’s Guide</a>). For now, just use TEX commands within dollar signs for your inline needs (<a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics">Wikibook</a>). For the rest, get and insert their MathML version <a href="https://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/mathml/asciimathdemo.html">manually</a>.</p>
<h2 id="feed">Feed</h2>
<p>For now, I just want to update the feed whenever I publish a new full essay. I don’t care about updating the feed for smaller changes. I don’t think there’s much value in that information for anyone.</p>
<p>Given that I only plan to publish a new essay once or twice a week, I don’t think I need an automatic feedmaker. I can update the <code>feed.xml</code> file manually.</p>
<p>Also, I’ll go with Atom for now, since it seems to be the way of the future. However, I’ll just go with the url as the id (Gwern seems to be doing that too, and he’s generating the feed automatically, so I guess I’m fine).</p>
<p>To get time for the “updated” element: use <code>date +%Y-%m-%dT%TZ</code></p>
<h1 id="markdown">Markdown</h1>
<p>To give a hover hint for a link, enter the hint after the <a href="foo.com/bar.html" title="Bar is not about Foo">link</a> like <code>[link] (foo.com/bar.html &quot;Bar is not about Foo&quot;)</code>.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Suppose you hear that an expensive hospital has a greater mortality rate than a less expensive hospital. Does that mean the doctors at the expensive hospital are worse (and that you’re therefore getting ripped off)? In other words, can we say that the quality of the doctors is the cause of the difference in mortality rate?</p>
<p>But what is the size of the diff? There are at least two factors that vary. The quality of the medical care may vary between the two hospitals, but so may the types of patients they see. It could be that the expensive hospital, for whatever reason, gets a lot more of patients <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/death_rates_not_best_judge_of_hospital_quality_researchers_say">who are</a> “too sick to be saved by the time they are admitted to the hospital”. Or maybe they get referred many more tough cases from other hospitals and naturally have a higher mortality rate than they would have on ordinary cases.</p>
<p>To narrow down the effect of their quality of medical care, you need to compare the two hospitals on similar patients and similar types of diseases.</p>
<p>For example, “As long as the fighting continued, soldiers were more eager to return home than after the war ended.” Given that they were “eager”, I think of how they wanted to escape death. But what if it said that they were “less eager”? I would have that they wouldn’t want to leave their fellow soldiers in the middle of a war. So I think of different factors based on the given outcome. I may get misled by the description. For example, “educated vs uneducated soldiers” emphasizes the education level but may miss out on the nutrition, upbringing, genetics, etc. You have to unpack the categories and look at any other correlated variables. Further, you may stop after considering a few (possibly irrelevant) factors and miss out on other relevant factors. You may miss out on the other possible outputs and their relevant factors.</p>
<p>Test:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Southern soldiers coped better with the hot South Sea Island climate than Northern soldiers. (Southerners are more accustomed to hot weather.)</li>
</ol>
<p>– <a href>Hindsight Devalues Science</a>, The Sequences</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I look at just one set of available variables for the explanation. Yes, the South is hotter than the North (afaik), so people from there would probably be more accustomed to hot weather. But that is hardly clinching evidence. There could be other causes for “coping”, some of which could outweigh the familiarity with hot weather. All I was trying to do was to weakly justify the explanation with some supporting evidence.</p>
<p>Basically, I got a positive and negative exemplar from memory and recognized them with the given explanation. Which means that I got one relevant factor - the climate in their home towns. But it doesn’t mean I got all the relevant factors. To eliminate all the other differing factors as irrelevant to the output, I need to show that they don’t toggle the output. Hometown climate isn’t the only thing that may differ between them. Their diet could too. As could the thickness of their uniforms, the size of their water bottles, or the duration of their marches.</p>
<p>So, a given explanation may emphasize a legitimate factor, which we can back up from past exemplars, but may neglect other relevant factors that differ between the two conditions. And since we probably don’t have a quantitative prediction for the output category, we risk explaining too much with a qualitative prediction. And all this is assuming that our original exemplars actually justified our proposed relevant factor. Further, if the neglected relevant factors go the other way, we might end up concluding wrongly.</p>
<p>Test:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. dismissed scientific studies of WWII soldiers’ experiences as “ponderous demonstrations” of common sense.</p>
<p>For example: 1. Better educated soldiers suffered more adjustment problems than less educated soldiers. (Intellectuals were less prepared for battle stresses than street-smart people.)</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Southern soldiers coped better with the hot South Sea Island climate than Northern soldiers. (Southerners are more accustomed to hot weather.)</p></li>
<li><p>White privates were more eager to be promoted to noncommissioned officers than Black privates. (Years of oppression take a toll on achievement motivation.)</p></li>
<li><p>Southern Blacks preferred Southern to Northern White officers (because Southern officers were more experienced and skilled in interacting with Blacks).</p></li>
<li><p>As long as the fighting continued, soldiers were more eager to return home than after the war ended. (During the fighting, soldiers knew they were in mortal danger.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>How many of these findings do you think you could have predicted in advance? 3 out of 5? 4 out of 5? Are there any cases where you would have predicted the opposite - where your model takes a hit? Take a moment to think before continuing…</p>
<p>In this demonstration (from Paul Lazarsfeld by way of Meyers), all of the findings above are the opposite of what was actually found. How many times did you think your model took a hit? How many times did you admit you would have been wrong? That’s how good your model really was.</p>
<p>The measure of your strength as a rationalist is your ability to be more confused by fiction than by reality.</p>
<p>Unless, of course, I reversed the results again. What do you think?</p>
<p>Do your thought processes at this point, where you really don’t know the answer, feel different from the thought processes you used to rationalize either side of the “known” answer?</p>
<p>– <a href>Hindsight Devalues Science</a>, The Sequences</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why does “intellectuals are more susceptible to battle stresses” seem plausible? I can imagine an intellectual being unused to such things (and probably being a nerd anyway) and getting traumatized easily. Why does “uneducated people are more susceptible than intellectuals” also seem somewhat plausible? I can imagine uneducated people perhaps not being able to realize that the war is happening to them for reasons outside their control and it’s not a punishment for their particular sins.</p>
<p>If someone says that people who listen to devotional songs become more peaceful. I don’t think of how adults were angry despite all the devotional songs. Listening to devotional songs makes me feel more peaceful than before, older people listen to it much more than me, and therefore they must be much more peaceful than me. What about all the other factors? You haven’t got a controlled experiment. And when you had a diff, it had other factors too.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: If people leave out factors when describing a diff, you will be more likely to attribute the change to the factors in the diff and miss out on the omitted factors.</p>

<p>Test:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve noticed that people at Amazon have a lot of important things to say, but those things are rarely recorded. If you give a brown-bag presentation, or send a thoughtful email to some internal mailing list, you’ll have an impact, but it won’t be anywhere near the impact you’ll have through blogging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other factors: Same quality? Maybe the mediums afford different kinds of material. For example, prose usually has more words in it than in a talk or an email. What if nobody reads your blog? At least you know that the people in the mailing list will read your email and the people at your presentation will listen to it.</p>

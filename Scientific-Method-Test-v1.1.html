<h1 id="scientific-method-v1.1">Scientific Method v1.1</h1>
<p>Let’s continue using my v1.0 algorithm: Look at each paragraph and get the causal link.</p>
<p>This time, pay attention to the direction of causality. Also, say precisely what effect each cause has.</p>
<p>First, think about whether it is correlation or causation. Then, think about whether one of them causes the other, or whether they have some common causal ancestor.</p>
<p>Mission: Use this on one PG essay.</p>
<p>Time: 1 hour</p>
<p>(Note: A -&gt; B stands for “A causes B”)</p>
<h1 id="black-swan-farming-by-pg">Black Swan Farming by PG</h1>
<h2 id="raw-correlations-and-causal-links">Raw correlations and causal links</h2>
<p>Different kinds of work -&gt; how counter-intuitive</p>
<p>idea -&gt; importance</p>
<p>% of top winners -&gt; % of returns</p>
<p>correlation between best ideas and how bad they seem initially</p>
<p>variations in startups -&gt; how much our expectations about variation are violated</p>
<p>Rather, the correlation is that when variations in success are low or “reasonably high”, are expectations are not violated; when variations are very high, our expectations are violated.</p>
<p>variation in success, our expectations -&gt; whether violation occurs or not. Specifically, if variation is very high, our expectations are violated; else, they’re not.</p>
<p>What is causing our expectations, then? Just human nature? So, will experience not make any difference at all?</p>
<p>Also, why is there vast variation in startup success?</p>
<p>Per batch, there’s a correlation between % of top winners and % of returns.</p>
<p>turn off your intuitions -&gt; succeed in domain; it’s a necessary condition - if you don’t turn off your intuitions, you won’t be successful at all.</p>
<p>Correlation: taking enough risks is hard. I think it is: turn off your intuitions -&gt; take more risks than the average bear.</p>
<p>And that is hard because turning off your intuitions is hard. Why is that, though?</p>
<p>likely to succeed moderately -&gt; fund them</p>
<h2 id="correlations">Correlations</h2>
<p>how likely they seem to succeed (moderately), funding them; It seems like: how likely -&gt; fund them. But, why does YC feel like funding them when they seem likely to succeed moderately? I think your intuitions play a role too. So: likely to succeed moderately, intuitions -&gt; fund them.</p>
<p>What makes some startups seem likely to succeed moderately? That should also make them actually likely to succeed moderately. seem likely to succeed moderately &lt;- x factor -&gt; be actually more likely to succeed moderately</p>
<p>chances of winning really big, how significant the returns will be; chances of winning moderately, how significant the returns will be. Given that a few startups succeed really big, the % increase in returns will be significant only for the new big winners. So: number of big winners (or current returns on investment), new returns -&gt; significance</p>
<p>chances of winning moderately and chances of winning really big; the latter is not a constant fraction of the former. What causes the correlation here? Wait, is there a correlation at all? PG says so. He says that big winners won’t seem like moderate winners. If you are more likely to be a big winner, then you won’t seem like a moderate winner. And, if you don’t seem like a moderate winner, you will have a small likelihood of being a big winner. So, why? I think what makes you likely to be a big winner makes you less likely to be a moderate winner.</p>
<p>x factor -&gt; big winner; x factor -&gt; less likely to be a moderate winner. So, if you don’t have that x factor, you won’t seem like a big winner and you will have a normal chance of being a moderate winner.</p>
<h2 id="harder---correlations-and-causes">Harder - Correlations and Causes</h2>
<p>quality of new startup ideas, how bad they seem at first. PG says: obviously good -&gt; would have already been done (i.e., won’t be new). So, any new idea would have to be not obviously good. new idea -&gt; successful idea; (all successful ideas would be new ideas, so they too would be not obviously good)</p>
<p>seems like a bad idea, is a good idea, how big you will succeed</p>
<p>ideas that seem bad, are bad vs good</p>
<p>best ideas seem like bad ideas, how hard it is to recognize the winners</p>
<p>retrospect, big successes seem obvious</p>
<p>Facebook, Microsoft, Apple - perfect bad ideas</p>
<p>[My analysis: how big you become, in terms of revenue or market share, depends on how much scarcity power you have (also on how big the market is).</p>
<p>scarcity power, market size -&gt; bigness.</p>
<p>goodness of idea x how good it seems: bad and seems bad, bad but doesn’t seem bad, good and seems good, good but doesn’t seem bad</p>
<p>The only startups that can succeed are those with good ideas (whether they seem good or not). But, good ideas that seem good (to many people) will have a lot of people behind them. So, even if your idea is good, you won’t have much scarcity power, and thus won’t be able to become really big. However, if you go after good ideas that seem bad, you at least have a chance of being the only game in town and becoming big (assuming that your market is big).</p>
<p>Also, if you’re in tune with the newest startups, you may find the moderately successful ideas to be good, but still find the really big ideas to be bad.]</p>
<p>good idea -&gt; can succeed</p>
<p>good idea, seems bad -&gt; scarcity power</p>
<p>in tune with latest trends -&gt; most good ideas will seem good (but the best ones still won’t)</p>
<h1 id="harder-still">Harder Still</h1>
<p>big winners, won’t know it for two years, harder to pick big winners (no indication of whether you’re doing it right); quality of strategy -&gt; feedback about success or failure (if you don’t have feedback, you can’t get evidence about your strategy); So, no feedback -&gt; won’t know about quality of strategy</p>
<p>% of startups that raise money on Demo Day, whether there is any big startup here. No correlation, except an inverse one. I think this is caused by the fact that they seem like bad ideas</p>
<p>how much money they raise after Demo Day &lt;- seem like bad ideas -&gt; whether they can go big</p>
<p>big winners, 10,000x returns; investment amount, % of company, eventual size of company -&gt; returns</p>
<p>risk usually proportionate to reward; scarcity power -&gt; reward; reasonably efficient market, risk -&gt; scarcity power (where risk is a chance of loss)</p>
<p>100% of all YC startups raise money after Demo Day, too conservative in picking startups; risky -&gt; expect many startups to fail. So, if very few fail, you’re being too conservative to get high rewards.</p>
<p>YC can afford to take 10x as much risk as Demo Day investors. amount of money you’re willing to invest in a startup -&gt; how confident you have to be about its success (assuming you’re quite risk-neutral, maybe by investing in a lot of startups). Note that this is so because startups are black or white in their success. You either make money or you die.</p>
<p>10x more risk, 10x more startups</p>
<p>if you start measuring something, you start optimizing it; measure -&gt; start optimizing it (why?)</p>
<p>30% startups are fundable at Demo Day, everyone would agree that YC had jumped the shark</p>
<p>PG can lay out the right thing to do, and not do it; action in line with intuitions -&gt; do it (else, don’t); nothing else matters</p>
<p>so conservative, not yet assimilated the fact of 1000x returns; understood notion of 1000x returns -&gt; more risk</p>
<p>say who cares what investors will think, fund more big winners; try to optimize for investors’ funding -&gt; pick moderately successful startups (aka ideas that seem good) -&gt; they won’t have too much scarcity power -&gt; won’t give big winners</p>

<p>Big Winners: scarcity power, market size -&gt; bigness</p>
<p>Be Risky: big winners -&gt; 1000x-10,000x returns -&gt; understand -&gt; take more risk (plus reasonably efficient market) -&gt; scarcity power</p>
<p>Indicator: risk -&gt; expect many startups to fail</p>
<p>Stymied by Intuitions: if actions match intuitions -&gt; do it; else, don’t. Nothing else matters</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>First, identify the correlations. And then investigate causes.</p>
<p>At each step, ask if it is a correlation or a cause.</p>
<p>For every variable, ask what its cause is.</p>
<h1 id="further-questions">Further Questions</h1>
<p>Exactly how do you determine whether A causes B? What conditions do you need to satisfy? I get the feeling you need to show that P(B|A,X) = P(B|A) for all X. That is, knowing A screens off the effects of all non-descendants. But, what does that require, in non-math terms?</p>
<p>Say A and B are binary variables. What if A=on makes B=on, but A=off doesn’t say anything about B? How do you represent that as a causal link? What if C=on is what makes B=off (when A=off)? How do you show that?</p>

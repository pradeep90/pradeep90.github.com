<h1 id="why-learn-to-pay-attention">Why Learn to Pay Attention?</h1>
<h2 id="deep-thinking-and-warm-up-time">Deep Thinking and Warm-up Time</h2>
<p>How right can PG be! It is only after a few hours of working on an essay or program that you start getting the really good ideas. Just doing it for an hour or so doesn’t seem to be enough. I would have missed the above insights had I just gone with my original plans and not pushed through my resistance.</p>
<h2 id="to-do-something-hard-give-it-your-full-attention">To do something Hard, Give it your Full Attention</h2>
<p>Apartment search lessons: It’s like running a startup (though I haven’t done that): you have to give it your undivided attention. I was hoping to do it on the side while the others focussed on it for a day or two and got the job done beautifully. Man, people have a <em>lot</em> of information about apartment search. This guy has a list of 7 property sites and links to the FB groups for Indian grad students at Purdue.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-pay-attention">How to Pay Attention</h1>
<h2 id="necessary-condition-lack-of-distraction">Necessary condition: Lack of Distraction</h2>
<p>I think a lack of distractions is key to deep focus. Hotel lobbies and airports have this quality. So do libraries and study rooms. On the other hand, the simplest of things can cause distractions. Like your internet-enabled smartphone, tablet, laptop, or even your music player.</p>
<p>You must have nothing else whatsoever to focus on but your subject matter. Nothing to take your mind off.</p>
<p>Unexpected places have these qualities. And other places that you would expect to have these qualities don’t. For example, some of my deepest moments of focus have come on aeroplanes. Unless you give in to the crappy movie player in front of you or dive into your own smartphone movie player, there is literally no distraction.</p>
<h2 id="obstacle-as-time-flies-more-distractions-creep-in">Obstacle: As Time flies, more Distractions creep in</h2>
<p>Here’s a rough hypothesis: The more time we spend in an environment, the more distractions we manage to bring in.</p>
<p>Consider the first time you move to a new house or office. Initially, nothing is set up. You probably don’t have wifi working, or a TV, or anything. You don’t have comfortable furniture around, most probably. So, you have no choice but to focus deeply on whatever you’re doing. But, over time, you figure out various ways of distracting yourself - what the nearby movie theaters are, what restaurants deliver food at your home, what you can do in your relaxation time, etc.</p>
<p>Soon, your place abounds with distractions. You can’t get anything done.</p>
<h2 id="to-pay-attention-categorize-something-from-scratch">To Pay Attention, Categorize something from Scratch</h2>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: You pay full attention when you have to actually categorize something.</p>
<p>For example, they tell you to pay attention to your mistakes when you’re practicing. What does that mean? I made a mistake when I typed “washingon monument” instead of “washington monument”, but I didn’t realize it. It was only after I’d ruled out a problem with the dictionary program that I started to look at the words letter-by-letter and found the missing ‘t’. In other words, you can’t assume that you’ve done it right when you <em>feel</em> you’ve done it right. You can’t trust the labels given. You have to start categorizing from the bottom.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-spend-your-time-well">How to Spend your Time Well</h1>
<h2 id="cut-the-umbilical-cord-turn-off-the-internet">Cut the Umbilical Cord: Turn off the Internet</h2>
<p><strong>Principle</strong>: When you’re working, turn off the internet.</p>
<p>As Cal Newport recommends, schedule your distractions for specific periods. Apart from that, just turn it off.</p>
<h2 id="weaken-strong-habits-by-changing-the-environment">Weaken Strong Habits by Changing the Environment</h2>
<p>My aim is to weaken habits that are undesirable but strong and strengthen ones that are desirable but weak.</p>
<p>Which habits are strong right now? Watching movies and surfing online (that’s how I spent my day). Which ones are weak? Practicing skills and summarizing my old notes.</p>
<p>A change of environment would help. Reading books on my tablet would weaken my habit of sitting in front of my laptop for hours on end watching movies or videos. Similarly, practicing with pen and paper would help stave off on-screen distractions. Turning off the internet during my work hours would certainly work too.</p>
<p>(Technically, I’m not weakening the habit, just removing the cue that triggers it. I end up doing it less, which is what matters.)</p>
<h2 id="comparative-advantage-calculate-the-per-hour-value-of-a-task">Comparative Advantage: Calculate the Per-Hour Value of a Task</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>When I started my business I thought it would be amazing if I eventually earned $100 per hour working on it. (This is a princely sum for 20-something programmers in Japan.) Its funny, people generally get very good with practical experiences of the mathematical properties of averages in school and then totally forget about that experience in business. If you want a 92 average, you’d better not routinely get 60s on your homework. If you want to earn $100 an hour, you’d better not busy yourself with $5 an hour tasks.</p>
<p>– <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2009/10/04/work-smarter-not-harder/"></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Question: Am I getting $50 worth of value every hour out of this?</p>
<h2 id="schedule-deep-work-and-punish-dawdling">Schedule Deep Work and Punish Dawdling</h2>
<p><strong>Experiment</strong>: Set aside 6pm-9pm every day for deep work. Don’t surf or distract yourself in any way.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: Based on Cal Newport’s Deep Work, this should help me get into the habit of doing substantial amounts of deep work every day.</p>
<p>Measurement: Number of hours of deep work, i.e., zero distraction and peak cognitive capacity.</p>
<h2 id="consequential-deadlines-make-you-spend-time">Consequential Deadlines make you spend Time</h2>
<p>Observation: I’ve had severe deadlines for the past two weeks. I couldn’t afford to take my eye off the game for any period of time (to indulge in either fantasies or YouTube binges). Guess what? I did a ton of deep work. Respected the LeechBlock limits on my web surfing. Actually read books after a long time. Life’s good.</p>
<p>Observation: Contrast that to all the times where I did the exact opposite and couldn’t muster the will to even close a YouTube video.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: Deadlines cause motivation (due to low delay) and thus automatically eliminate shallow work, which comes about because low-value actions are more tempting.</p>
<p>Corollary: The deadlines need to be for high-value tasks; otherwise, you’ll have high motivation for nonsense like some random bureaucratic forms you need to fill.</p>
<p>Lesson: So, if you’re bitching and moaning about not being able to do deep work, ask yourself if there’s any valuable deadline you’re trying to meet.</p>
<h2 id="dont-give-youtube-control-of-your-time">Don’t give YouTube control of your Time</h2>
<p>When you open Youtube or Twitter or Reddit for whatever purpose, you get a ton of incidental information that grabs your attention. An enticing video, a “thought-provoking” tweet from a famous person, or a bunch of new posts with a lot of votes. Those stimuli impose themselves on your mind. You get side-tracked from your goal.</p>
<p>You should be in charge of what thoughts come into your mind. If you really want to get more ideas from some luminary, <em>you</em> should be in control - you should read a book written by him or maybe watch a talk he gave. The only thoughts that enter your mind should be those explicitly approved by you, to the extent possible.</p>
<p>For example, on a news website, my eye is automatically drawn to the “Top Stories” sidebar - there’s some scare story about a terrorist, a review of the upcoming Batman vs Superman movie, a video about Virat Kohli - how can I not click any of them or at least not think about them?</p>
<p>It’s the same thing at the end of the news article. There’s an “Also read” column at the bottom showing intriguing pictures - some guy threw a slipper at a politician, some female celebrity was playing Holi, and so on.</p>
<h1 id="deep-work-environments-paying-attention-for-long-periods">Deep Work Environments: Paying Attention for Long Periods</h1>
<h2 id="nothing-like-an-airport-for-deep-work">Nothing like an Airport for Deep Work</h2>
<p>Observation: Thought deeply for hours on end - on the shuttle ride, in the airport, and on the plane itself.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: Nothing like it.</p>
<p>Observation: Zero distractions. Nowhere else to be. Nobody to distract you. Unfamiliar environment, so I don’t revert to my usual web-surfing habits.</p>
<h2 id="hotel-room">Hotel Room</h2>
<p>Observation: Things are neatly organized in a hotel room. There’s no residue from your past work over there. It’s all been reset to the default. Contrast that to your own house. There are the loose sheets from a previous assignment, clothes that need to be laundered, books lying here and there, an old lamp you’ve been meaning to fix for the last six months, and so on.</p>
<p>Observation: You don’t have to worry about anything else.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: Wow. It’s a strict interface. All you can do is your deep work (and, of course, other enjoyable stuff).</p>

<p>Steve Yegge writes about the ideal conditions for deep thinking in his post <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/innovation-101">Innovation 101</a>.</p>
<p>The pop-neuroscience book Your Brain at Work has a great chapter on distraction.</p>

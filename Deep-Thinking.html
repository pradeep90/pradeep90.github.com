<h1 id="necessary-conditions">Necessary conditions</h1>
<p>I think a lack of distractions is key to deep focus. Hotel lobbies and airports have this quality. So do libraries and study rooms. On the other hand, the simplest of things can cause distractions. Like your internet-enabled smartphone, tablet, laptop, or even your music player.</p>
<p>You must have nothing else whatsoever to focus on but your subject matter. Nothing to take your mind off.</p>
<p>Unexpected places have these qualities. And other places that you would expect to have these qualities don’t. For example, some of my deepest moments of focus have come on aeroplanes. Unless you give in to the crappy movie player in front of you or dive into your own smartphone movie player, there is literally no distraction.</p>
<h1 id="as-time-flies">As time flies</h1>
<p>Here’s a rough hypothesis: The more time we spend in an environment, the more distractions we manage to bring in.</p>
<p>Consider the first time you move to a new house or office. Initially, nothing is set up. You probably don’t have wifi working, or a TV, or anything. You don’t have comfortable furniture around, most probably. So, you have no choice but to focus deeply on whatever you’re doing. But, over time, you figure out various ways of distracting yourself - what the nearby movie theaters are, what restaurants deliver food at your home, what you can do in your relaxation time, etc.</p>
<p>Soon, your place abounds with distractions. You can’t get anything done.</p>
<h1 id="deep-thinking-and-startup-time">Deep Thinking and Startup Time</h1>
<p>How right can PG be! It is only after a few hours of working on an essay or program that you start getting the really good ideas. Just doing it for an hour or so doesn’t seem to be enough. I would have missed the above insights had I just gone with my original plans and not pushed through my resistance.</p>
<h1 id="musical-memetic-hazards">Musical Memetic Hazards</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s tempting to think that it doesn’t matter much what kind of music is popular. So long as people like it, don’t worry, it’s just a bit of fun. But music is one of the biggest influences that shapes a culture. It encourages an attitude to life. The songs get inside our heads and the ideas they carry with them stay there - influencing how we value ourselves and our goals.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Songs have great memetic power. You listen to them over and over, and they play in the back of your mind constantly. At times, you can’t get a tune out of your head. So, this means that they will take up a lot of your mind space. And if you strengthen the ideas you use a lot, then perhaps the ideas in those songs will get reinforced in your mind without your knowledge. Be careful what you let in.</p>
<h1 id="embracing-boredom">Embracing Boredom</h1>
<p>From a Louis CK video:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On texting while driving: “People are willing to risk taking a life, and ruining their own, ’cause they don’t want to be alone for a second.”</p>

<p>Steve Yegge writes about the ideal conditions for deep thinking in his post <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/innovation-101">Innovation 101</a>.</p>
<p>The pop-neuroscience book Your Brain at Work has a great chapter on distraction.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Where did I think I had original ideas only to discover that other people had done it before and done it way better?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="blind-spot">Blind Spot</h1>
<p>This is an empirical study designed to smash my own intellectual arrogance and teach me the <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/3m3/the_neglected_virtue_of_scholarship/">Virtue of Scholarship</a>.</p>
<p>I want to show myself the places where I discovered others doing something much better than I did.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have a blind spot around strategies that involve doing nice things for other people, to the point where it stops you from achieving your selfish values.</p>
<p>– Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, <a href>Chapter 108, HPMOR</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a blind spot around strategies that involve learning things from other people (instead of “inventing” them myself), to the point where it stops me from achieving my own values.</p>
<p>I try to “figure things out for myself” and thus fall heavily for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">Not Invented Here Syndrome</a>. I discover some ideas on my own and, because of Commitment and Consistency, I think they’re epic and awesome. Now, since they’re so awesome, I completely fail to study the literature on how people have solved the same problem. In other words, I fall for the <a href>Technique Trap</a>.</p>
<h1 id="why-so-blind-son">Why so blind, son?</h1>
<p>It’s not like I hadn’t heard of people who did a lot of literature research before writing their posts. Lukeprog on LessWrong is definitely a person like that. And I had read his explicit warnings a long time ago in <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/3m3/the_neglected_virtue_of_scholarship/">The Neglected Virtue of Scholarship</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The lesson I take from these and a hundred other examples is to employ the rationality virtue of scholarship. Stand on the shoulders of giants. We don’t each need to cut our own path into a subject right from the point of near-total ignorance. That’s silly. Just catch the bus on the road of knowledge paved by hundreds of diligent workers before you, and get off somewhere near where the road finally fades into fresh jungle. Study enough to have a view of the current state of the debate so you don’t waste your time on paths that have already dead-ended, or on arguments that have already been refuted. <strong>Catch up before you speak up.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is why, in more than 1000 posts on my own blog, I’ve said almost nothing that is original.</strong> Most of my posts instead summarize what other experts have said, in an effort to bring myself and my readers up to the level of the current debate on a subject <strong>before we try to make new contributions to it</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then why didn’t I heed his words?</p>
<p>Well, every time I came across that passage, I thought Luke was being stupid - “in more than 1000 posts… nothing that is original”?! That’s crazy! When will you get started on, you know, actually solving some problems? You can’t wait for others to solve all your problems.</p>
<p>True. But, I now realize, you can’t <em>not</em> wait for other scientists to thoroughly test your favoured beliefs. You need to be super-empirical. One wrong step can take you anywhere. An Affective Death Spiral around a wrong solution is the <em>default</em> outcome. Unless you are extremely rigorous, that is what will happen. Our minds are that bad at thinking correctly.</p>
<p>Why didn’t I understand this point earlier?</p>
<p>TODO</p>
<h1 id="spaced-repetition">Spaced Repetition</h1>
<p>In around 2012, I had thought of the idea of a bunch of review questions that would cover all the important points in a textbook chapter. They were like the unit tests that cover all the important logic in a program.</p>
<p>And then I came across the idea of <a href>Spaced Repetition</a>. The people using it were basing it on well-understood psychological facts (the Spacing Effect and the Testing Effect) and had automated it.</p>
<p>Any Spaced Repetition system worked better out of the box than my own vague, poorly-specified idea of “utils” (which is what I called my pseudo unit tests). If I had only thought to search around for testing systems already being used.</p>

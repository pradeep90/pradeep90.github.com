<h1 id="chapter-three---too-tired-to-resist-why-self-control-is-like-a-muscle">Chapter Three - Too Tired to Resist: Why Self-Control Is Like A Muscle</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Correlation between exam week and various characteristics of students: energy levels, how much caffeine and sugar they consume, how much they exercise, how much they smoke, how healthy their food choices are, personal hygiene, etc. Apparently, things are different in the previous 10 weeks of college. Hypotheses: participation in exam week could cause these changes, or these changes could cause participation in exam week (no, exam week came first), or something could cause them both (but, your participation is decided at the start of the school year). So, participation in exam week must be causing the lowered self-control. But, it seems like a distant cause to me. Do other factors come in between?</p>
<p>Another correlation: “people who use their willpower tend to run out of it”. Actually, this is experimental evidence - you intervene and make them use their willpower, and then you find out that they have less of it. Variables: “how much” willpower they are able to exert, time.</p>
<p>Wait. Now that you put it in the form of a variable, it seems much more vague. How do we say that somebody has “run out of willpower”? How do we observe or manipulate this “willpower” thing? How can we measure how much willpower some task has used? I guess it’s about controlling your impulses, where “impulses” are judged so by humans because we don’t understand them well enough to describe them mathematically. Basically, doing stuff you don’t feel like doing, not doing stuff you feel like doing, and doing stuff that matches your goals regardless of how you feel about it.</p>
<p>“Smokers who go without a cigarette for twenty-four hours are more likely to binge on ice cream.” Variables: time without cigarette, % of binging on icecream. This was experimental evidence so time without cigarette caused % of binging on icecream.</p>
<p>“Drinkers who resist their favorite cocktail become physically weaker on a test of endurance.” Variables: say no when offered favourite cocktail, physical endurance. This too was experimental evidence.</p>
<p>“Perhaps most disturbingly, people who are on a diet are more likely to cheat on their spouse.” Variables: on a diet, % of cheaters. Experimental evidence here too.</p>
<p>Correlation between time of day and willpower: highest in the morning and steadily deteriorates over course of the day. (I suspect this is about the time passed since you woke up, not the objective time of the day.) Variables: time since awakening, willpower. Time since awakening is caused by the passage of time, nothing can affect that. So, the passage of time must be causing the decrease in willpower. I think what happens is that humans as living creatures think and act, which needs time, and these thoughts and actions deplete their willpower. That’s one hypothesis (H1). Another one (H2) is that the willpower in your mind is like a radioactive substance - it will decrease at some rate even if you don’t act.</p>
<p>So, how exactly do these hypotheses differ? Well, they differ in the direct causes of willpower. H1 says that willpower depletion depends purely on the actions you take (and they depend on time for their execution, but that doesn’t matter, that’s not a direct cause). H2 says that willpower depletion depends on actions as well as on the time elapsed - taking impulse-control action will deplete willpower but so will just the raw passage of time. We can think of a third hypothesis H3 that says willpower depletion depends only on the raw passage of time, no matter what actions you take.</p>
<p>H1 and H2 differ in the role of time; so, keep the actions the same but change the time elapsed - maybe do nothing at all for hours. H2 says that willpower should have decreased, while H1 begs to disagree. H2 and H3 (as also H1 and H3) differ in the role of actions; so, for the same time period, take lots of actions in one case and don’t do anything in the other case. H3 says that willpower will decrease by the same amount, H2 says it won’t.</p>
<p>Alternative hypothesis: virtue - you do crap because you suck. Variables: virtue, willpower. Virtue could be causing you to have willpower. So, the only cause of willpower is your virtue. Therefore, time or actions should not change willpower in any way. But, they do.</p>
<h2 id="the-muscle-model-of-self-control">The Muscle Model of Self-Control</h2>
<p>Roy Baumeister’s experimental evidence: No matter what willpower-exerting task he posed, he found that people’s willpower deteriorated over time. Variables: type of willpower-exerting task, whether willpower deteriorates over time. These were interventions, so we can generalize that willpower exertion is a direct cause of willpower depletion. So, in general, no matter what else you do, if you exert willpower, you will lose a corresponding amount of willpower. (Yes, in the future we may discover some intermediate variables between willpower exertion and depletion, which screen off the effect of exertion. But, for now, we know of nothing that will prevent the effect.)</p>
<p>Note, however that there are two possible hypotheses here. Willpower exertion on a task of one type could cause willpower depletion on the task of the same type, yet not change anything for other kinds of tasks. Call this H1. Alternatively, willpower exertion on any task could cause willpower depletion on any other task (H2). Basically, H1 says that willpower depletion on task of type A is caused only by willpower exertion on previous tasks of type A, whereas H2 says that willpower depletion on tasks of type A is caused by willpower exertion on any kind of task. H1 and H2 differ when the previous task is of some other type.</p>
<p>Also, a concentration task was followed by depleted physical strength. Variables: concentration, physical strength. So, concentration in the first task is correlated with depleted strength in the second. Either concentration is causing deployed strength or something is causing both. Well, what have we seen so far that causes decrease in strength (keeping other factors constant)? Willpower! So, concentration is depleting willpower for physical strength. This eliminates H1. There must be a common source of willpower for all kinds of tasks.</p>
<p>Denying yourself sweets was correlated by procrastination later. Variables: whether you accepted the sweets, how much you procrastinate</p>
<p>Correlation between pausing and planning and using up willpower.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-self-control-limited">Why is Self-Control Limited?</h2>
<p>Hypothesis: willpower exertion depends on brain energy?</p>
<p>Experiment: The more the blood sugar dropped after a self-control task, the worse the performance on the next task. So, willpower exertion caused blood sugar to drop (by how much?).</p>
<p>Also, they observed a correlation between blood sugar drop and performance on the next task. I’m not sure whether the correlation was about the absolute blood sugar level, % drop in blood sugar level, or absolute drop in blood sugar level. Also, if it’s about the drop in blood sugar level, what happens when you don’t have a change in your blood sugar level - how do you predict your willpower, then? Let’s just call it blood sugar drop for now.</p>
<p>Anyway, I suspect it is a correlation, not necessarily causation, because they didn’t manipulate the blood sugar level directly. So, the willpower exertion could have caused blood sugar to drop and also separately caused poorer performance on the next task (as has been observed before), or the blood sugar drop could have caused poorer performance. (Poorer performance on the second task could not have caused blood sugar drop because it came afterwards.)</p>
<p>How do these hypotheses differ? Both say that blood sugar drop is caused by willpower exertion. No difference there. Next, the first one says that performance on a self-control task (aka available willpower) depends only on prior willpower exertion. But, the second one says willpower depends only on blood sugar level (which in turn depends on willpower exertion). If we try to test by exerting willpower, both will predict the same decrease in willpower, because exertion will decrease blood sugar level and therefore decrease willpower. However, if you change the blood sugar level alone, then the first hypothesis predicts that nothing should change regarding available willpower. (Remember, however, that we aren’t yet clear about what “blood sugar level” means - it could be the relative change in blood sugar, or the absolute change, or the absolute level).</p>
<p>Experiment: for willpower-drained participants, boosting blood sugar level (using a sugar drink) caused self-control to increase. (Not sure exactly by how much, though.)</p>
<p>How much did you need to increase the blood sugar level? Why did you need a full glass of sugary lemonade?</p>
<p>And we’ve seen earlier that there is some internal store of willpower that somehow decides how much self-control you can exert. So, if blood sugar level allows you to exert more self-control, it must be doing so by determining the amount of willpower you have.</p>
<p>Correlation: people with low blood sugar are more likely to rely on stereotypes.</p>
<p>Experiment: giving participants a sugar boost causes them to be more persistent and less impulsive.</p>
<h3 id="confusion">Confusion</h3>
<p>Wait. So, what is the overall picture here? Exerting willpower causes blood sugar to drop. And, somehow your blood sugar level determines the amount of willpower available to you. It’s like you can’t use a lot of willpower if your blood sugar level is low.</p>
<p>How exactly does the “amount of willpower” you have determine your success at self-control in a task? Is it that if your willpower is very low, you won’t be able to do some tasks at all, no matter how hard you try? Or will you not even try? Does it depend on the intensity of the self-control needed?</p>
<p>The reason we need to be careful here is that “willpower” is not directly observable or manipulable. What we know about it is that exerting self-control decreases it and that when it is low, you can’t exert much self-control. However, neither of those links are precise. How much some task decrease your willpower? What does the exact amount depend on - the intensity of the task, how much you like it, and so on? Similarly, how does your ability to exert self-control depend on the amount of willpower?</p>
<p>The evidence so far is that the amount of self-control you’re able to exert on a task is correlated with your blood sugar level somehow, and that using self-control uses up the willpower you have (and thus decreases the blood sugar level).</p>
<p>One hypothesis (H1) is that the amount of self-control you can potentially exert is proportional to the absolute blood sugar level and that the drop in blood sugar level is proportional to the amount of self-control you actually use. Another hypothesis (H2) is that the drop in blood sugar level is a fixed unit, that no matter what self-control task you do, your blood sugar goes down by the same extent. Another one (H3) is that it is a fixed percentage of the total blood sugar level. Yet another one (H4) is that the drop in blood sugar level is proportional to the amount of self-control you use, and that the amount of self-control you can potentially exert is whatever you can afford - if you have enough blood sugar to do it, you will be able to.</p>
<p>We can think of H5 that says the amount of self-control you can exert doesn’t depend on the blood sugar level at all. But, it’s falsified by the lemonade experiment. Well, what else could directly cause the amount of self-control you can exert? Blood sugar level somehow, ok, that’s supported by the lemonade experiment. What about your state of mind? Maybe if you’re pessimistic or sad or in love, you won’t be able to exert as much self-control.</p>
<p>How do these hypotheses differ? Look at the variable “amount of self-control you can exert”. H1, H2, and H3 say it depends only on the absolute blood sugar level; you will be able to do all the tasks that require self-control within a certain threshold, and none of the tasks that require more than that. So, no matter what else changes, if your blood sugar is at a certain level, you will be able to do all the self-control tasks that fall within that level. H4 says much the same thing. So, no differing predictions here.</p>
<p>Where they all differ is in the variable “drop in blood sugar level” when exerting self-control. H1 and H4 predict the same thing (in fact, they don’t make any differing predictions at all, they just seemed different to me) - the drop will be proportional to the self-control used. H2 says that the drop is a fixed unit. H3 says that it is a fixed percentage of the absolute blood sugar level. Distinguish between H1 and H2 by doing tasks requiring different amounts of self-control. Distinguish between H2 and H3 by doing tasks when you’re at different levels of blood sugar.</p>
<h3 id="energy-crisis">Energy Crisis</h3>
<p>Experiment: Either increase or decrease the blood sugar level (using regular vs diet soda) and observe how much participants choose immediate gratification over long-term payoffs.</p>
<p>The direction of change in blood sugar level, not the absolute change, predicted how much self-control they had.</p>
<p>The hypothesis they present is that the direction of change in blood sugar level flips the brain’s state of wanting to conserve or spend energy, which in turn decides how much self-control is available to you. So, the brain’s decision about wanting to spend energy on impulse-control depends on the direction of blood sugar level change, and the amount of willpower you have depends on your brain’s decision to spend energy.</p>
<p>Let’s look at those two variables separately. What could be the possible causes of your brain’s decision to spend energy on self-control? Maybe the direction of blood sugar level change is a factor. But, could the absolute level of blood sugar be a factor too? However, in the experiment, they found that the absolute level did not correlate with success at self-control.</p>
<h3 id="people-whore-starving-shouldnt-say-no-to-a-snack">People who’re starving shouldn’t say no to a snack</h3>
<p>Correlation: humans are more likely to take any kind of risk when they’re hungry. So, hunger could cause risky behaviour, or risky behaviour could cause hunger (but the hunger came before), or something could cause both. What are the known immediate causes of hunger? Not eating for a period of time (or vomiting what you already ate, I suppose). Risky behaviour doesn’t seem capable of doing that, at least not in general.</p>
<p>What could cause risky behaviour? Well, a lack of willpower could do it. And what causes a lack of willpower? Your brain’s decision to not spend energy. And that, in turn, apparently requires a change in the direction of blood sugar level. So, somehow either hunger or not eating for a while must change the direction of blood sugar level (or must directly change the brain’s decision to spend energy).</p>
<h2 id="training-the-willpower-muscle">Training the Willpower Muscle</h2>
<p>Intervention: Asking people to tackle one small thing they aren’t used to controlling causes them to control that thing as well as other self-control challenges like diets, exercise, etc.</p>
<p>So, given that we know all self-control tasks draw from the same source, we must assume that the above exercise must have increased that source of willpower somehow. But, the amount of willpower you have depends on the amount of energy the brain decides to spend, which depends on the blood sugar level. Is self-control exercise increasing the blood sugar level? Or is it perhaps bypassing it somehow and convincing the brain to spend more energy on willpower? These are testable questions. In the first case, we expect the blood sugar level to change after you do these willpower exercises; in the second case, we don’t.</p>
<p>Or, is it that the brain doesn’t spend any more energy but rather becomes more efficient at exerting self-control? Kelly suggests that it is the habit of noticing what you’re about to do and choosing to do the more difficult thing that you’re actually practicing in the above exercises.</p>
<p>This seems like a new mechanism that comes between the energy available to the brain and the amount of self-control exerted. One hypothesis is willpower depends on the energy available, but also on how good your brain is at noticing and choosing to do the more difficult thing. This contrasts with the earlier hypothesis about how willpower depends only on the energy available to the brain. How do we distinguish between them? Train the person on willpower exercises and set their blood sugar level using lemonade or whatever. The new hypothesis predicts that even at the same blood sugar level, they will display more self-control after training; the old hypothesis says that they will display the same self-control.</p>

<p>Willpower depends on how much energy is available in your brain for self-control and how strong your self-control habits are.</p>

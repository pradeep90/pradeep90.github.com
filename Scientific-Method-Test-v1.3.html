<h1 id="scientific-method-v1.3">Scientific Method v1.3</h1>
<p>Let’s continue using my v1.0 algorithm: Look at each paragraph and get the causal link.</p>
<p>At each step, ask if it is a correlation or a cause. In the first pass, identify the correlations. Next, ensure that each part of your correlation is a variable. Operationalize, in other words. Then, investigate causes. Use time and space to figure out the direction of causality. Finally, for every top-level variable, ask what its cause is.</p>
<p>For the causal links you posit, ask how the cause leads to the effect.</p>
<p>Mission: Use this on one PG essay.</p>
<p>Time: 30 minutes</p>
<p>(Note: A -&gt; B stands for “A causes B”)</p>
<h1 id="bradleys-ghost-by-pg">Bradley’s Ghost by PG</h1>
<h2 id="correlations">Correlations</h2>
<p>In every swing state, the exit polls’ estimation of the Kerry vote was greater than the actual Kerry vote. (Are you predicting that the vote will be greater or that it will be decisively wrong?)</p>
<p>Tom Bradley: comfortable lead in polls, lost</p>
<p>In theory, aka the alternative hypothesis, exit polls should be very accurate (on what count? % difference from actual polls or winner prediction). Why? Because you’re asking people what they just did (not asking what they would do - in which case you would expect discrepancies). ask what they just did -&gt; high accuracy; ask what they would do -&gt; lower accuracy (by how much)</p>
<p>number of polled people who don’t answer, accuracy of exit polls;</p>
<p>ask every 20th person, some people don’t want to answer; ignore them, sample no longer random (representativeness of sample)</p>
<p>currently, when people don’t respond, pollsters note down their age, race, and sex, and guess</p>
<p>no correlation between who people vote for and whether they’re willing to talk about it (P(not respond | vote for X or Y) = P(not respond)), doing guesswork for people who didn’t answer should give a random sample; no correlation between voting and willingness to talk, guessing for non-respondents -&gt; random sample</p>
<p>significant number of people who voted for Bush (what %), didn’t want to say so</p>
<p>people in the US (what %), “more conservative” than they’re willing to admit (#conservative beliefs that they don’t want to admit); two variables - how conservative they admit they are, how conservative they really are. What makes them so conservative? Let’s leave that aside. Why don’t they admit it readily? Maybe they don’t want to sound out of sync with elite values. What decides who they think are elite? actual conservativeness, values of those they consider elite -&gt; admitted conservativeness</p>
<p>values of elite in the country (who? values about what?), values of NPR (about what? anything?); values of elite (who?) -&gt; values of NPR (I suspect it’s a feedback loop somehow)</p>
<p>average person, more socially conservative (how could you possibly know that?)</p>
<p>others don’t share opinions of elite (how many, exactly?), feel nervous about it (?? is this a latent variable?); your opinions, elite opinions -&gt; nervousness;</p>
<p>NPR says don’t say homophobic things, people are religious (how many? how religious?), people are homophobic? (well, ask what they will or won’t do), keep their opinions (they don’t change them - at all?), and keep them to themselves (how many of them will keep it to themselves? a lot?); nervousness -&gt; keep to themselves. Does nervousness make you change your opinions sometimes? Or does it just drive you to hide them?</p>
<p>They know what they’re supposed to believe, stranger asks, won’t always say what they believe (what percentage of the time? on what issues? how many will not respond? Remember, it was apparently only a matter of a few percentage points between Kerry and Bush. Also, how many <em>will</em> respond?); values, elite values, stranger asks -&gt; % won’t say what they believe. I think the two cases (value difference vs not) should differ only by a few percentage points.</p>
<p>values of elite are liberal, polls will tend to underestimate the conservativeness of ordinary voters (by how much?)</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Requirement for exit poll accuracy: no correlation between voting and willingness to talk (A), guessing for non-respondents -&gt; random sample; random sample, exit polls -&gt; accurate predictions</p>
<p>More conservative than they care to admit: Many Americans are more conservative than “elites”. your opinions, elite opinions, keep opinion to themselves -&gt; no nervousness when they differ (however, if they express their opinion to strangers, they will feel nervous);</p>
<p>Inaccurate polls: Bush voters -&gt; more likely not to respond -&gt; correlation in (A) -&gt; exit polls will be inaccurate</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>I think I must ask for more precise predictions - exactly how much will B change because of A?</p>
<p>Try asking “what would falsify this?” for all the causal links.</p>
<p>It might help to enumerate the other possible outcomes - the ones that will <em>not</em> happen.</p>
<p>Look for other consequences of a cause.</p>
<p>What do you think you know and how do you think you know it? Basically, what evidence do you have to support this hypothesis?</p>

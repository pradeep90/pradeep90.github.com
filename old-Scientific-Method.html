<p><strong>Questions</strong>: How can we think scientifically?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="where-do-i-apply-the-scientific-method">Where do I apply the Scientific Method?</h1>
<p>Short answer: wherever I’m uncertain.</p>
<p>Still, there’s the question of value of information. Where would I gain most by reducing my uncertainty? I need to look at the most risky decisions in my life, the ones where I expect to pay a heavy price for failure. Basically, what important things don’t I know?</p>
<p>I want to know how to feel motivated to do what I need to do. I want to know how to get to the truth about important things. I want to learn skills really well. I want to know how to collaborate well with people. I want to know how to create novel and useful things. I want to know how to have good emotional health.</p>
<p>Most of these are in the area of psychology. That means they probably require a ton of evidence backing them, because it’s such a complex area. I will likely not be able to discover new and important things all by myself. So, I would need to do a lot of scholarship to catch up with the existing knowledge. In fact, I should probably refrain from <a href="./Why-I-should-study-existing-sources-first.html">just inventing things myself</a> until I’ve reached the state of the art. The game would be about mastering skills that others have researched well.</p>
<p>In short, to solve problems people haven’t solved already, I need to do original research. But, I need to search long and hard before I conclude so.</p>
<p>Therefore, when I’m designing new things (programs, essays, plans, whatever), I need to apply the scientific method myself. This is even for intangible things like my plan for mastering a technique - I need to update on the evidence and see whether I really am learning it well.</p>
<p>Where do I need to do a lot of scholarship? Creating motivation, seeking the truth, learning skills, building emotional health, and collaborating.</p>
<p>Where do I need to do a lot of original research? Creating new and complex things, designing individual plans for goals, etc.</p>
<p>Also, in some cases, I will need to evaluate hypotheses that others have built. For example, in controversial domains or where there is no clear consensus.</p>
<p>What are specific questions I want to answer?</p>
<p>The causal structure of strange or awesome things: How exactly does Will Power work? How exactly does Motivation work? How exactly can you use Haskell and category theory to solve hard problems in programming? What makes for good writing? How can we have good emotional health?</p>
<p>Properties of important subjects: How far can this idea help me? How long will it take me to start getting results?</p>
<h1 id="science-making-your-causal-model-more-precise">Science = Making your Causal Model more precise</h1>
<p>Science is about using more and more evidence to refine our causal model. This applies whether we’re doing research or just learning from some resource.</p>
<p>When you’re learning, especially from an informal source, you need to collect the evidence and build a precise causal model yourself. Why? Because people rarely provide it. Example: “Humans fall for the Halo Effect”. This may seem like a hypothesis, but in fact it doesn’t tell you much. You can’t predict exactly how much, say, attractiveness will make you think that the person is also intelligent. You may not even be able to predict which traits you will wrongly correlate. So, you need to build a causal model from scratch (using their hints) and by making sure it covers all the evidence you see.</p>
<p>Also, sometimes, we don’t (or can’t) crunch all the evidence we have. So, we end up with alternative hypotheses. Some hypotheses may cover certain evidence better. We need to make the causal models precise like before. Then, we need to look at their differing predictions and run experiments or otherwise get evidence. Finally, we need to take all the evidence and build a winner hypothesis that covers everything.</p>
<p>Note that we need to keep track of all the states of the world that we care about. That way, we can generate better experiments.</p>
<h1 id="rationality-vs-traditional-rationality">Rationality vs Traditional Rationality</h1>
<p>Hint: Look at Eliezer’s sequence about Science vs Rationality.</p>
<p>Roughly, the main differences seem to be in handling confusion, researching with speed, formulating good hypotheses, and reasoning well based on scanty evidence.</p>
<p>Show how your model of the scientific method provides the above features. Refrain from using probability-theory based explanations. I suspect the basic scientific method itself should be enough.</p>
<h1 id="domain-experts-vs-theoretical-scientists">Domain Experts vs Theoretical Scientists</h1>
<p>Ordinary domain experts may have more precise models of their domain than scientists, because they collect rich, empirical evidence. For example, schoolteachers have a decent idea of what will happen if they walk out of the class for five minutes or if they announce a surprise test, etc. Theoretical scientists who try to predict the behaviour of the class from fundamentals may struggle to make precise predictions.</p>
<p>You may have read lots of social science papers about the Halo Effect or Reciprocity, but a half-decent salesman will do a much better job than you at manipulating and predicting the behaviour of a customer. He can tell precisely how they will behave, given his years of experience on the job.</p>
<p>In short, scientists may have abstract models that tell you the direction of some effect (“attractive people will seem more intelligent than they are”) but people who work directly in the field will probably have more concrete information (how many more sales I make when I wear a good tie or a nice skirt).</p>
<p>Field practitioners will have more accurate <em>predictions</em> about situations they encounter frequently, be it in sales, psychotherapy, plumbing, or programming. They may not have a good causal model backing those predictions - for example, they may be caught short in scenarios that are vastly different - but their predictions will be spot on in their limited circle. They may not know exactly why things work a certain way, but they know enough to get their job done.</p>
<p>Corollary: If you want to understand a topic generally, talk to the scientists. If you want specific predictions, talk to the field practitioners.</p>
<p>Why should it be this way? Why can’t scientists get narrow, accurate predictions too?</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<h2 id="causal-model-and-programming">Causal Model and Programming</h2>
<p>Building a causal model, I suspect, is nothing but programming.</p>
<p>In computer programming, we use a well-understood programming language to describe a process that will give us the behaviour we want. Thankfully, computers can use our descriptions to create the processes in real life so we can observe any property we want.</p>
<p>In science, as I understand it, we use a less well-defined language to describe real-world processes. And because the language isn’t well-defined, computers can’t instantiate the processes we describe. Perhaps the domains here are more complex than those that computer programs deal with, so it’s harder to describe it well.</p>
<p>However, if we understand the language of the domain reasonably well, we may be able to use the powerful techniques of computer programming here and leverage them to make faster progress. Also, if we understand the domain well enough, we may be able to design new and more powerful languages.</p>
<h2 id="science-and-programming">Science and Programming</h2>
<p>Hypotheses are programs. If science is about formulating and testing hypotheses, how can you do that without writing programs (in whatever language)?</p>
<p>Writing programs would force you to be explicit about your ideas and would probably resolve most “debates”. The point is, right now scientists are dealing with implicit programs - models in their head or maybe stuff written out in technical jargon. Can we do better?</p>
<h2 id="science-and-products">Science and Products</h2>
<p>It’s products we really care about, not the research that leads to it. If you could somehow magically get a new, fast, safe flying vehicle without doing any sort of research for it, you would grab it instantly. We care about research to the extent that it leads to useful products.</p>
<p>So why aren’t scientists working directly on products? Why do we have people working on pure research, apparently divorced from the practical side of things?</p>
<h2 id="essays-and-causal-models">Essays and Causal Models</h2>
<p>Essays are about getting a good causal model of the subject. Essay writers may not use the scientific method explicitly, but the end is much the same. You don’t just talk about the topic on the surface, you dig deeper. You posit causes for the phenomena you see. You may not be doing it rigorously, but if you have a lot of experience in the domain, you will hit the target more often than not. Paul Graham is a great example in the domain of startups and programming languages and writing.</p>
<p>You can’t write a good essay without positing a causal model, I suspect. We might find it awkward to read an essay without a “because”. We might find it empty and without substance. An easy test: compare essays with usual internet blog posts. I find the latter to be utterly devoid of substance. I predict that the blog posts I find to be shallow and empty will not present any causal model of the subject they’re talking about. Let me stick my neck out further: I predict that bad writing will not present any causal model, period.</p>
<p>Yes, good writing needs style, too. That may even be half the work of writing, as PG says, but I think positing a cause for the phenomena you see is the first business of essay writing. Remember, an essay has to be true before it is beautiful. All considerations of beauty and style come after we have decided the questions of fact.</p>
<p>PG is already ahead of the curve here (again). He says that he writes essays with the sole purpose of figuring things out. What is that but getting a good causal model of a subject? Even more importantly, he consciously aims for maximum surprise! That is, he wants to come up with hypotheses that differ from conventional ones in ways that matter.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Also, essay-writing (and I suspect any detailed form of writing) forces you to be explicit about your hypothesis. Because you’re writing for a neutral smart reader who doesn’t already know the topic, you have to specify all the details of your model and show exactly how it predicts what you claim it does. You can’t slip by with a half-baked mysterious “model” the way you can when you’re just thinking. It can be hard to see in your head where the model falls short but in writing the holes in your thinking become plain to everyone.</p>
<p>Remember how we saw that hypotheses are nothing but programs? Essays are just one medium for writing those “programs”. Yes, it’s in technical English and it isn’t very precise, but it does a good job.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>In short, I suspect that essay-writing is just scientific thinking in disguise. There may be no explicit hypothesis testing or rigorous use of empirical evidence, but at the end of the day, you are still positing causes for things and trying to reject those ruled out by evidence.</p>
<p>This tells us how we might optimize essay-writing. The closer we can get to scientific thinking, by being more empirical with the evidence we collect and using probabilities where we can and making our hypotheses more falsifiable, the better our ideas (and thus our essays) will be.</p>
<h2 id="clear-thinking-in-everyday-life">Clear thinking in everyday life</h2>
<p>Don’t take any action until you can think of a causal model that narrowly predicts your next action. Ask “why”. Why are you doing this? Will this lead to good outcomes?</p>
<p>Each action should be backed by a causal model. Like, if you’re doing some exercise with the goal of burning fat, then you should have a causal model of fat-loss singling out that particular exercise as the best one for burning fat. You should know how much you need to exercise per day and how fast you can expect to lose fat at that rate.</p>
<h2 id="science-and-skill">Science and Skill</h2>
<p>First, we build an explicit causal model of the domain we care about. We ensure that the external hypothesis is fully capable of handling the likely states of the system. Then, we burn each part of the causal model into our head with practice. So, we can now make predictions about the domain without having to refer to the external model. We will have it in our head. We will have the information at our fingertips, so to speak.</p>
<h2 id="sidenote-science-vs-design">Sidenote: Science vs Design?</h2>
<p>One of my beliefs right now is that if we started thinking more scientifically, we would solve a lot more problems quickly. I need to drill down to the core of this and find out exactly when (or if) this is true, and how far scientific thinking can help me.</p>
<p>Let us look at the conventional hypothesis I differ from. How else do people suggest you should think?</p>
<p>In the sciences, they mostly already use the scientific method. So, we have no difference there. Where do people not use the scientific method? In programming, for example. In businesses too, I believe. In the arts - writing, singing, composing, acting, etc. When people are designing things, I think they tend not to use the scientific method directly (this is a testable prediction).</p>
<p>So, my hypothesis is that the scientific method is great for figuring out the rules in a domain - why something behaves the way it does. Once you roughly know the rules, I think you tend to use a different kind of process to design things.</p>
<p>In programming, you know the core rules of your language. And now you want to build a program that satisfies certain criteria. Hmmm… the problem is you don’t really know the final program you want. You cannot visualize all the requirements in your head, they are too numerous. Plus, they keep changing over time. So, maybe what you’re uncertain about here isn’t the working of the language, it’s what you want to build and how you want to build it.</p>
<p>The same holds for other areas of design, I think. In writing, you may know the basic rules of grammar, but you’re unsure about what you really want to say and how you want to say it. Similarly for composing music or painting, I suppose.</p>
<p>In physics, chemistry, and the other sciences, the problem was that we humans were unsure about the rules of the domain itself. We didn’t know how exactly gravity worked, or which chemicals would combine to do what, or what each part of our body did. The main aim there was to discover the rules of the domain - the laws of physics, the properties of chemicals, the anatomy of the human body.</p>
<p>If the scientific method (or Bayesian thinking) is theoretically the most efficient way of getting correct knowledge about the world, why do we not use it when designing things? Is it because of our cognitive limitations? Or is the nature of the problem itself different from those in physics or chemistry? In short, is there a difference between reduction and creation?</p>
<p>When designing, it is not the rules you’re unsure of, it is the product you want to design. You are unsure of the exact combination of building blocks that will pass the feedback test. You are even unsure of the exact feedback test you should use. In most projects, both the product and the feedback mechanism used evolve over time.</p>
<p>However, just because you’re unsure about a different thing doesn’t mean you should change the reasoning you use to get to the answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just because I’m ignorant about the universe doesn’t mean that I’m unsure about how I should reason in the presence of my uncertainty. The laws for thinking with probabilities are no less iron than the laws that govern old-fashioned logic</p>
<p>– Harry Potter, <a href>HPMOR Chapter 17</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think we should use the scientific method no matter what we are uncertain about. Perhaps we can use some approximations if our mind can’t handle the full-blown thing.</p>
<p>What is the difference, though, between a usual science problem and a design problem? You have more control over the subject in the latter. In programming, for instance, you deal with something that is completely man-made, you have as much control as you want over the behaviour of the system. Perhaps this means there are far more variables to control for. There may be too much information to hold in your head - like when working on very large programs. Similarly, you may find it hard to make changes. It may also be really hard to come up with hypotheses in the first place.</p>
<p>However, that doesn’t mean you can just go ahead and do whatever you want. There is a right way to think under uncertainty, and every other way of thinking will be provably worse. If you don’t use the laws of probability to think, how else will you decide what to do?</p>
<p>That is the core of my argument here. There is a right way of thinking under uncertainty, and whenever we deviate or choose an ad hoc path, we will do worse. Of course, we may not be able to think perfectly, but even given our bounded resources, I claim that we can do better.</p>
<p>Insofar as our thought processes mimic the right way, you will get good results. We need not be fully conscious of what we’re doing. So, the aim isn’t to deliberately think in a scientific way at each step. The aim is to make our thought processes hew as closely to the ideal way of thinking as possible.</p>
<p>How do we make our thought processes match the ideal way of thinking as much as possible, in a variety of concrete domains?</p>
<h2 id="taboo-no-magic-numbers">Taboo: No magic numbers</h2>
<p>In programming, we have a rule: your code should not have any magic numbers embedded in it. The statement <code>return foo * 25;</code> will be dismissed immediately by any decent programmer. Why? Because there is no apparent reason for the existence of 25. Why is it 25, why not 26 or 24? It may represent the number of students in a class, but suppose next semester the number of students changes, how are you supposed to know what to change?</p>
<p>Similarly, your hypothesis should not have any magic numbers embedded in it. “Cockroaches are sensitive to electromagnetic radiation of frequency 50Hz” - that should raise a red flag immediately. Why are you talking about 50Hz? Why not 60Hz or 174Hz? What will happen in those cases? Sadly, your “hypothesis” doesn’t say anything there. A good hypothesis would tell us exactly how the behaviour of the cockroach changes with electromagnetic radiation, and so help us calculate its response for a range of frequencies.</p>
<p>Along the same line, your hypothesis should not have any unjustified magic effects. “If a plant receives fertilizer, then it will grow to be bigger than a plant that doesn’t receive fertilizer” - why are you talking about fertilizers in particular? Do you have any causal model that tells you <em>how</em> fertilizers will help plants grow bigger? Yes, you may have observed fertilizer helping plants several times, but that should just leave you puzzled because you have no clue why it is happening that way. For example, what will happen if I dump double the amount of fertilizer? Will the growth double? What if I only add a tiny bit, will the growth diminish?</p>
<p>What if I change the type of fertilizer - instead of phosphate, what if I use ammonia or whatever (I’m just pulling these out of my ass)? In fact, what makes a “fertilizer”? “Fertilizer” is just a label that people put on certain chemicals. What if you had a box labelled “Poison” and you give it to the plant and their growth doubled, would you say that Poison makes plants grow?</p>
<p>Let me resolve the confusion. We need to taboo key terms in our hypothesis so that we understand exactly why things are happening. Don’t use the term “electromagnetic radiation”: “Cockroaches are sensitive to qnthla” - see how silly that sounds? It doesn’t explain anything. In fact, go ahead and taboo “cockroaches” and “sensitive” too. Now, you’re forced to explain exactly how the radiation burns their antenna (or whatever; I’m making this up because I Am Not A Biologist) and how they try to escape antenna-burning. Now, you have several fronts on which this hypothesis is testable, all the better for it to be accepted strongly if it emerges unscathed. You might find some other species whose antenna is sensitive to radiation, or you can try some other ways of burning their antenna, whatever.</p>
<p>In short, don’t write your hypotheses in a natural language like English. Write them in the technical language of the domain, where you can’t escape out of tough situations by just hand-waving or using suggestive names.</p>
<p>(Thanks to Dr Paul Strode who taught me the difference between research hypotheses and mere predictions - <a href="https://mrdrscienceteacher.wordpress.com/2014/11/02/teaching-the-hypothesis/">web page</a>; <a href="http://www.collegedevelopmentnetwork.ac.uk/download-document/6016-difference-between-a-hypothesis-and-a-prediction">great presentation</a>)</p>
<h2 id="testing-my-conception-of-science-v1.0">Testing my Conception of Science v1.0</h2>
<p>I’ll test my idea of a hypothesis on the list of example “hypotheses” provided by Dr. Paul Strode.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is hypothesized that a forefoot strike pattern will correlate with lower ground reaction forces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What happens when you do some other strike pattern? Will you get lower or higher ground reaction? I can’t see a causal model here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is hypothesized that the structural and functional integrity of the system as a whole is dependent on nerve activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cool. But that still doesn’t help me make any predictions. It is as vague as you can get. What happens if there is a lot of nerve activity? What happens if there is very little nerve activity?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We aimed to test the hypothesis of whether young healthy women will increase muscle mass and lose fat mass after undergoing 12 wk of intense resistance training (Josse et al. 2010).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This just a method followed by a prediction. Why would intense resistance training make you increase muscle mass and lose fat mass? What if I did light resistance training? Would I gain a lot more muscle or a lot less muscle? What if I did it for 50 weeks instead of 12? What about just 1 week? What results will I see? Your “hypothesis” does nothing to answer these questions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If food is present in the aquarium, then snails will move with greater speed (toward the food) (Green 2004).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is just a prediction. What if you place no food, just the smell of it? What if you place dummy food? Wait. Taboo “food”. What if you place a tasty burger? What if you place a rotting dog corpse? Will the snails still move with the same gusto?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aspirin inhibits key oncogenic factors and/ or activates pivotal tumor suppressor genes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah. This is getting closer and closer to a causal model. You can test this in several ways - make somebody eat aspirin, maybe inject them with aspirin (is that possible?), or do something else that reliably increases aspirin content in the brain. All of those should work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a plant receives fertilizer, then they will grow to be bigger than a plant that doesn t receive fertilizer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a prediction, without a precise method or hypothesis. How much fertilizer? Of what kind? For how many days? What will happen if I change any of those parameters - will the plant grow more or less? You need to answer the “why” of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marsh grass growth is limited by available nitrogen (Miller and Levine 2010).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is close to a causal model. It predicts a lot - you can test it by keeping nitrogen level constant and increasing everything else (growth shouldn’t be affected, because nitrogen is the limiting factor); you can test it by increasing the nitrogen level. Of course, it would be better if it explained exactly how nitrogen affects growth, which might help us figure out the exact relation between growth and nitrogen level.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the farmer burns the prairie then the next year will produce taller plants in his field then the previous year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just a method followed by prediction. Why is the burning of the prairie connected to the height of the plants? What if you burn some other part of the farm? What if you burn stuff, grow something else for a year, and then grow another crop - will they be taller than usual? And so on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on this observation, we hypothesized that natural selection may have influenced AMY1 copy number in certain human populations (Perry et al. 2007).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why is AMY1 present? Why isn’t it absent? Which specific human populations does your model predict will have this thing? Why them? Why not others? What sort of fitness advantage does it give so that it keeps propagating itself? Why is it not in everybody?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fire is replenishing the nutrients in the soil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a decent causal model, but not very precise. What kind of nutrients? What kind of fire? How does it depend on the duration of the fire? What if you pour water immediately afterwards? Does it take time for the nutrients to get “replenished”? Do you have to wait till you start planting the crops? Where exactly do the nutrients go? What if I removed the top layer of the soil (or have a flood that does the same)? Can you replenish the nutrients some other way?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The foraging patterns of S. carpocapsae, as measured by directional response, are affected by electrical fields.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok. But how? What if you keep changing the intensity of the electrical fields? Do they revert when you stop the electrical field? What about other kinds of radiation? What about other species? Does your causal model predict why their foraging pattern (of all things) might be affected by electrical fields?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe resin content of various pine species will affect its energy output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok. But how exactly does the energy output vary with the resin content? Can you predict the relation across a wide variety of existing pine species? What if I introduce more resin into the tree? What if I remove the resin content (I’m talking out of my ass here, pardon me)? What if people genetically modify some pine species so that it has more resin content? Talking about cause, why do you predict that resin content will affect the energy output at all? What is your explanation for the link between the two?</p>
<h2 id="what-science-is-not">What Science is not</h2>
<p>Science is all about getting an accurate causal model of some domain.</p>
<p>Having a causal model is not optional. Without it you just have a bunch of predictions, so you will be severely penalized when you’re asked about a different random experiment. This is also what Eliezer was talking about in Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions. You need to have a causal model making the predictions. That is why everything will become super-clear and there will be no more confusion. For you will be able to see <em>everything</em>!</p>
<p>State-transition model is key here. Your hypothesis doesn’t just work with variables (dependent or independent or whatever). It works with the entire state. In the future, if I look at some other variable, your hypothesis should make correct predictions.</p>
<h1 id="causal-model-as-a-program">Causal Model as a Program</h1>
<p>What is a “causal model”? Taboo that phrase. It is something that gives you a prediction for some experiment. Actually, it tells you the next state given some previous state.</p>
<p>The next state of what? The entire world? Well, ideally, yes. But, we can’t possibly compute the next state for every single atom in the entire world.</p>
<p>You need to know the state of the system at every point. However, knowing that in full detail is impossible. So, you create a cheaper model of the system and use that instead. Instead of using the language elements provided by reality, you create your own and make sure that it approximates the system.</p>
<p>Basically, you create a cheaper model of reality’s state-transition function. For the states of what - the whole world or of a particular system (collection of atoms)?</p>
<p>Reality has just one layer, it is we who add layers of abstraction to let our puny brains handle things. Let’s just say that atoms are the most fundamental layer of reality (it’s probably quarks or quantum fields, but still).</p>
<p>Physics gives you a causal model to describe how atoms behave. We can build other models on top of physics to describe higher abstractions, like objects, people, crops, whatever. This is similar to how programmers build higher-level languages on top of assembly language so that they can describe more complex processes. In the end, the program that they run is still in assembly language, they just deal with it differently. Similarly, the higher-level causal models we have, like that of minds in psychology or planets in astronomy, still talk about atoms, we just deal with them differently.</p>
<p>That’s what all the scientific domains do. They give you a language to describe reality at the abstraction level they care about. Chemistry is the study of matter, as Walter White says, psychology is the study of minds, and so on.</p>
<p>I want a fully reductionistic version of causal models. Why? Because that is the only way to precisely answer all possible questions about the world. Also, because I want our models to scale to very complex problems. We have a pretty good idea of how to scale a reductionistic model to tackle giant, hairy problems - that’s what programming is about.</p>
<p>In any case, our causal model is about some particular system, not the entire world. The atoms in that system will work according to the laws of physics, and so the higher level model which are built on top of physics will describe how the more abstract state of the system evolves.</p>

<p>What domain-specific languages do people use to express hypotheses?</p>
<p>Describe the features of some languages in domains like psychology, physics, astronomy, etc. and show some hypotheses written in those languages.</p>
<p>Specifically, talk about the kind of hypotheses <em>not</em> allowed by the language. That is what determines how good the language is.</p>
<hr />
<p>Remember to use your hypothesis explicitly to make predictions (not using your mind). Also, judge it purely using predictive power. Can the alternative formulations of hypotheses give you the same predictive power (like using relationships between independent and dependent variables)?</p>
<p>How am I testing if a formulation of causal models is good enough? I need evidence to help me judge formulations. I should have a bunch of questions to see if the causal model formulation is able to answer all of them.</p>
<h2 id="reality-as-a-programming-language">Reality as a Programming Language</h2>
<p>What do I want from this formulation of causal models? I want to know how to extend a causal model based on some evidence, generate alternative hypotheses, and test a model effectively. Also, how to compose models.</p>
<p>Let’s analyze the language using the framework provided in <a href>SICP</a>: primitives, means of composition, and means of abstraction.</p>
<p>If we look at a causal model as a program, what does it do?</p>
<p>Once you realize that you have to compose causal models to get bigger ones, you know you can test individual sub-models and put them together with confidence. You know you can choose a different sub-model (of the same type) and create an alternative model.</p>
<p>Could a causal model simply be a cause: A causes B? Is that rich enough to capture all the state-transitions in the world? Basically, I want something that can express any possible state-transition - that’s what a causal model is for. Wait, what does that mean, A “causes” B? Alternatively, could we have a model being a state-transition for a set of related inputs (like a function)?</p>
<p>What about feedback loops?</p>
<p>Maybe how you extend hypotheses is you get causes for each prediction, and then you try to combine them in a succinct way. You look at known causes that lead to that particular state. Then, you look at other causes that lead to the input state of that cause, and so on till you have a chain of causes from the initial state to the final state.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-build-causal-models-lessons-from-programming">How to build Causal Models: Lessons from Programming</h2>
<p>Let’s look at the world of programming. A causal model is nothing but a program. And, in functional programming, a program can be taken to be a single function that takes an input and gives an output.</p>
<p>How can you describe the program? A valid way is to enumerate all the possible inputs and specify their outputs. However, not only is this tedious, it’s heavily penalized by Occam’s Razor because it’s too long. So, another way is to write the function as a composition of smaller functions. The same issue occurs with the smaller functions, and so you build a function hierarchically, till you bottom-out by using fundamental language elements.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can think of a causal model as a composition of smaller causes, each of which takes the world from a set of input states to a set of output states, thus giving you an overall “cause” that takes the world from the set of initial states to the set of final states.</p>
<p>How do we build causal models based on new evidence?</p>
<p>We can see this in terms of changing the input and output sets of the model. Initially, our model may handle only a few input states (and thus as many output states - since we assume that the world is deterministic - one input state leads to exactly one output state).</p>
<p>The type of a function tells you what sort of values you can give it as input and what sort of values you can expect. Similarly, the type of a causal model, or the abstraction we use, will tell you what information about the input state you must tell it and what information about the output state it can tell you in return.</p>
<p>If we want to handle more values in a function, we extend it by composing more sub-functions (anywhere along the chain) or using different sub-functions. However, we take care to meet the type requirements at each point.</p>
<p>We infer how the composed function will work by analyzing the behaviour of the component functions (in a similar fashion, until we hit some fundamental functions) and extrapolating.</p>
<p>We generate alternative causal models (aka programs) by using different valid functions along the causal chain.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that we have to rely on our not-fully-understood mental processes to do much of the work for us. If we could understand this stuff well enough to describe it to a computer, we would have AGI, which we don’t.</p>
<h2 id="start-simple-dig-deeper-when-in-trouble">Start simple; Dig deeper when in trouble</h2>
<p>Remember that you can work at a superficial level for simple stuff. Don’t go too high up the causal chain. Don’t taboo too much.</p>
<p>Say you notice that a tap is dripping. Why? An independent variable is how much the valve is open. A dependent variable is how much water is flowing out of the tap. We generally characterize the tap by saying that the amount of water flowing out is proportional to how much the valve is open. However, this is only true because of other properties of the tap - the inner structure should be well-built, it shouldn’t be blocked, etc.</p>
<p>In most cases, the above relationship will do. It will give you the predictive power you want (which is all we care about).</p>
<p>So, perhaps, we must first figure out a relationship between variables, and then look for some causal explanation. We must build hypotheses iteratively and start digging deeper only when our initial hypothesis can’t handle some experiment.</p>
<p>Basically, you have two hypotheses: one saying that the underlying mechanism of the system is fine and that therefore a simple relationship (water flow is proportional to the valve’s opening) will hold; the other one saying that the core is not fine and that the relationship will not hold. So, we use the system assuming that the relationship holds. If we find that it doesn’t, then we need to dig deeper into the underlying mechanism and fix the real problem (some kind of blockage in the tap, or no water in the tank).</p>
<p>In any case, you should understand the underlying mechanism that supports the simple relationship you use, i.e., be aware of the assumptions you’re making.</p>

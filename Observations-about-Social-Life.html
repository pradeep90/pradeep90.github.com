<h1 id="one-reason-we-watch-new-movies-together">One reason we watch new movies together</h1>
<p>Why are people obsessed with new movies? There are probably many factors affecting it.</p>
<p>The other night, two friends (H and N) and I got together to watch some movies at home. I was looking forward to watching “Mad Max: Fury Road”, but found that the other two had already watched it. Ok, then we thought of watching “1408”, a 2007 horror movie, that H and I hadn’t seen before. We’d heard good things about it, but that plan got shot down because N had watched it when it was released. We tried re-watching “The Lego Movie”, but I had watched that dozens of times and H had too, so we were talking over the movie pointing out the various cool bits while N looked on haplessly. That wasn’t much fun. So, now we were running out of options. We saw the pilot of the TV series “Lie to Me” simply because H and N hadn’t, but I’d watched it before and it was no fun for me. Finally, after a lot of further trials, we watched “The Blair Witch Project” since none of us had seen that before.</p>
<p>In the end, none of us had had much fun at all. I would have been happy to watch “Mad Max”, but instead had to watch either stuff I’d watched before or some weak horror movie. H and I both wanted to see “1408” but couldn’t. N would have enjoyed “The Lego Movie” but couldn’t. Nobody really benefited. If we’d known it would have sucked so much, we would have agreed to watch one movie we had already seen so that somebody could enjoy it and then watch another that we hadn’t. Everyone would have been better off.</p>
<p>So, why didn’t we?</p>
<p>One unstated rule of watching movies with your friends or family is that you don’t watch a movie that some have watched and the others haven’t. It should either be a new experience for everyone or an old classic that you’re reliving together. Otherwise, you’re not all feeling the same things together - be it the thrill or suspense or comedy. Just knowing that the other person knows what’s coming next can dull the edge. Moreover, you’re imposing on those who’ve watched it by asking them to sit through it again. So, courtesy dictates that you choose something nobody has seen.</p>
<p>Also, I find that most people don’t like watching the same movies again. And even if they might do so when they’re alone, it won’t be a good return on time for an entire group. You only get together rarely (more so when you’re all older and busier), so it makes sense to pick something fresh.</p>
<p>So, the only real option as a group is to watch new movies. This is true even if the new movie is crap and you could have enjoyed some old movie better. There are just too many constraints to juggle.</p>
<p>You could think you might watch some old movie that none of you has watched. But, the more you diverge (as you get older and have a wider group of friends), the more unlikely it is that none of you has watched some particular movie. Remember, even if one guy has watched the movie, it’s disqualified.</p>
<p>So, for the sake of the group, you’re usually stuck watching new movies, which are mostly crap.</p>
<p>This might hold for songs too.</p>

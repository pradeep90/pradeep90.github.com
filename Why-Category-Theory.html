<p><strong>Question</strong>: Given a <code>children</code> function, how will you write a <code>greatgrandchildren</code> function?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="composing-simple-functions">Composing Simple Functions</h1>
<p>You can obviously compose functions to get functions. Composing <code>a -&gt; b</code> and <code>b -&gt; c</code> will give you <code>a -&gt; c</code>.</p>
<p>Assume <code>square</code> is of type <code>Int -&gt; Int</code> and <code>cube</code> is of type <code>Int -&gt; Int</code>, then you can write:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">	power6 <span class="fu">=</span> cube <span class="fu">.</span> square</code></pre></div>
<p>Neat and simple. Couldn’t have put it better. The “.” there is the compose operator. It put square and cube together to get a new function.</p>
<p>Similarly, <code>a -&gt; b</code> and <code>b -&gt; c</code> and … <code>y -&gt; z</code> give you <code>a -&gt; z</code>.</p>
<h1 id="composition-is-not-just-for-simple-functions">Composition is Not Just for Simple Functions</h1>
<p>But say you have a function <code>children</code> of type <code>Human -&gt; [Human]</code>?</p>
<p>How will you write a function that gives a person’s grandchildren? You have to go through all kinds of trouble just to say what you would have said in three words in English - children of children.</p>
<p>Even in a good functional language like Scheme, you would have to say:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode scheme"><code class="sourceCode scheme">	(<span class="kw">define</span><span class="fu"> grandchildren </span>(x)
		(concat (map children (children x))))</code></pre></div>
<p>That map in there is basically looping over the list of children and getting their children and the concat is putting them all together.</p>
<p>What about great-grandchildren, you ask? Children of children of children, right?</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode scheme"><code class="sourceCode scheme">	(<span class="kw">define</span><span class="fu"> great-grandchildren </span>(x)
		(concat (map children (concat (map children (children x))))))</code></pre></div>
<p>or, if you cheat and use grandchildren:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode scheme"><code class="sourceCode scheme">	(<span class="kw">define</span><span class="fu"> great-grandchildren </span>(x)
		(concat (map children (grandchildren x))))</code></pre></div>
<p>We desperately want to say grandchildren are just children of children, but Scheme is not letting us. Can’t we compose children with children? Nope. The types don’t match. <code>children</code> takes a Human and returns a <strong>list</strong> of Humans, so you can’t pass that on to <code>children</code>.</p>
<p>Monads to the rescue.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">	grandChildren <span class="fu">=</span> children <span class="fu">&lt;=&lt;</span> children

	greatGrandChildren <span class="fu">=</span> children <span class="fu">&lt;=&lt;</span> children <span class="fu">&lt;=&lt;</span> children</code></pre></div>
<p>What do you say about that!</p>
<p>You can see the similarity to function composition. Just like we used “.” to put square and cube together, we’re using “&lt;=&lt;” here to put children and children together.</p>
<p>The <code>.</code> operator is the way to compose functions that share the same output and input type (respectively).</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;=&lt;</code> operator is the way to compose functions that share almost the same output and input type - just that for one, the output is wrapped in some form.</p>
<p>We call these monadic functions. For <code>children</code>, the output was wrapped in a list (<code>[Human]</code>).</p>
<p>We can pull the same trick with lots of functions with lots of different kinds of wrappings.</p>
<p>(Note: I’m being loose in my descriptions here. Just use the “wrapping” analogy as a jumping board for now.)</p>
<h1 id="call-me-maybe">Call Me Maybe</h1>
<p>For example, you have a function that usually works but may fail for some input. Like, say, <code>sqrt</code>. It takes an <code>Int</code> and returns another <code>Int</code>, but will fail on negative input.</p>
<p>So, we represent that output as a <code>Maybe Int</code>. It can either be <code>Just Int</code> (<code>sqrt 16 = Just 4</code>) or it can be <code>Nothing</code> (<code>sqrt -3924 = Nothing</code>). Nothing is basically our <code>null</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">	sqrt ::</span> <span class="dt">Int</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Maybe</span> <span class="dt">Int</span></code></pre></div>
<p>How can we write safe code using sqrt? For example, how would you write <code>x^(1/4)</code> using sqrt? In (pseudo) Java:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode java"><code class="sourceCode java">	Integer <span class="fu">fourthRoot</span>(Integer x) {
		<span class="co">// sqrt assumes that its input is non-null.</span>
		<span class="kw">if</span> (x == <span class="kw">null</span>)
			<span class="kw">return</span> <span class="kw">null</span>;
		Integer y = <span class="fu">sqrt</span>(x);
		<span class="kw">if</span> (y == <span class="kw">null</span>)
			<span class="kw">return</span> <span class="kw">null</span>
		<span class="kw">return</span> <span class="fu">sqrt</span>(y);
	}</code></pre></div>
<p>But, <code>x^(1/4)</code> is just sqrt of sqrt. We don’t want to do all that unnecessary null-checking. If anything is null along the way, the whole answer is null. Obvious! Why make me write it out by hand every time?</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">	fourthRoot <span class="fu">=</span> sqrt <span class="fu">&lt;=&lt;</span> sqrt</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, <code>&lt;=&lt;</code> let us compose two functions of <code>Int -&gt; Maybe Int</code> to get a new function of <code>Int -&gt; Maybe Int</code>.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you wanted to find some integer in a list and then take its square root. <code>find</code> can fail too - there may not be any matching element in the list. So, simplifying a bit, it’s type is <code>[Int] -&gt; Maybe Int</code>.</p>
<p>This means we can’t compose <code>sqrt</code> and <code>find</code>. If they could never fail then we could just do <code>sqrt . find</code>. Done. Do <code>find</code> first and then do <code>sqrt</code> on what you find. Piece of cake. But, nope. They can fail so their types aren’t compatible for function composition.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode java"><code class="sourceCode java">	Integer <span class="fu">findAndSqrt</span>(List&lt;Integer&gt; xs) {
		<span class="co">// findSomeElem expects non-null input.</span>
		<span class="kw">if</span> (xs == <span class="kw">null</span>)
			<span class="kw">return</span> <span class="kw">null</span>;
		Integer y = <span class="fu">findSomeElem</span>(xs);
		<span class="kw">if</span> (y == <span class="kw">null</span>) {
			<span class="kw">return</span> <span class="kw">null</span>;
		}
		<span class="kw">return</span> <span class="fu">sqrt</span>(y);
	}</code></pre></div>
<p>Again that nasty null-checking. No more.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">	findAndSqrt <span class="fu">=</span> sqrt <span class="fu">&lt;=&lt;</span> findSomeElem</code></pre></div>
<p>We can scale this up to an arbitrary number of functions.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">	doComplicatedProcessing <span class="fu">=</span> getAge <span class="fu">&lt;=&lt;</span> getFatherDetails <span class="fu">&lt;=&lt;</span> lookupPersonIdInDatabase <span class="fu">&lt;=&lt;</span> findMatchingId</code></pre></div>
<p>Each of those functions could return null. But, at no point did we have to stop thinking about our logic and go do some stupid null-checking. <code>&lt;=&lt;</code> let us do our job and just let us compose potentially failing functions elegantly.</p>
<p>There are tons of other applications for <code>&lt;=&lt;</code>. Anywhere you have functions that return “wrapped” values and you want to compose them, you can <code>&lt;=&lt;</code>.</p>
<p>Just like with normal function composition, we were able to put together a whole bunch of functions into one final function and do it with ease.</p>
<p>Ok. So we can compose normal functions, and we can compose wrapping functions (<a href>monadic</a> functions, in other words). Is that all?</p>
<h1 id="monoids">Monoids</h1>
<p>Let’s look at list concatenation. <code>l1 ++ l2</code> means appending l2 to l1.</p>
<pre><code>[1, 2] ++ [3, 4, 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

[1, 2] ++ [3, 4, 5] ++ [6, 7] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

= ([1, 2] ++ [3, 4, 5]) ++ [6, 7]

= [1, 2] ++ ([3, 4, 5] ++ [6, 7])</code></pre>
<p>All that to say that list concatenation is associative. The order in which you do those individual concatenations doesn’t change the result. Big deal. Right?</p>
<p>Also, the empty list concatenated to the left or right of any list just gives the same list back. Yo, that’s just another way of saying that <code>++</code> has a left and right identity.</p>
<p>Breaking news. So what?</p>
<p>The point is that even after putting together a lot of lists, you get one list in the end. You don’t have to worry about all the individual details. Put them together and now you’ve got one list to represent them all. You can even put this list together with other lists and still get a list back.</p>
<p>The complexity doesn’t rise up as you put together many lists. It says absolutely flat throughout.</p>
<p>The above properties don’t just hold for lists and strings. They hold for numbers too, under addition and multiplication.</p>
<p>They hold for functions that have the same input and output type. Gabriel gives the example of Plugins. You can think of a plugin for some application to be of type (Request -&gt; Data). It takes some request and returns the desired data.</p>
<h1 id="functions-as-monoids">Functions as Monoids</h1>
<p>Say you’re writing a search aggregator for some company. The idea is that employees will enter a phrase and you will bring in search results from the different parts of that company - say HR, manufacturing, marketing, whatever. All of these parts have their own customized search facility - manufacturing lets you search within their orders, marketing lets you search within their records, whatever. You need to bring all of that to one interface in front of the user.</p>
<p>At first, you decide to support searching just one department - the Software Engineering department. Easier to test your aggregator with just one search backend.</p>
<p>You write a function <code>getSWEnggSearchResult</code> of type <code>Search -&gt; SearchResult</code>. The <code>SearchResult</code> is some properly-formatted thing that you can display directly. You don’t need to know what is inside it. It has a “convertToHTML” method, so to speak, and you can just use that.</p>
<p>Cool. It works! All your hours of coding and debugging have paid off. Ok. Now, you need to add more backends.</p>
<p>You decide to add one more - HR Department. So, you write a function <code>getHRSearchResult</code> of type <code>Search -&gt; SearchResult</code>. And, in your main function, you first call <code>getSWEnggSearchResult</code> and insert its HTML output into your page. Then, you call <code>getHRSearchResult</code> and insert its HTML output into your page.</p>
<p>That works too! Then, you go ahead and do this for every single other goddamn department in your company. The main function balloons up with all kinds of <code>getFooSearchResults</code>.</p>
<p>Then, next month, the company merges with another company. You get 10 more departments whose search backends you have to support. Then, at the end of the year, that company is sold off to some other company - so you now need to split off your application into two - one that supports your company’s backends and one that supports theirs. You hand that over to them. And, so it goes on.</p>
<hr />
<p>What could you have done differently?</p>
<p>You say that the type of <code>Backend</code> is <code>Search -&gt; SearchResult</code>. If <code>SearchResult</code> is a Monoid (which it seems to be), then <code>Search -&gt; SearchResult</code> will automatically be a Monoid. We can easily compose all these Backends together.</p>
<p>I will use the <code>&lt;&gt;</code> sign to show appending of two Monoids.</p>
<p>We will call it <code>SWEnggBackend</code> instead of <code>getSWEnggSearchResult</code>.</p>
<p>So, initially:</p>
<pre><code>backend = SWEnggBackend</code></pre>
<p>Then, you added the HR backend.</p>
<pre><code>backend = SWEnggBackend &lt;&gt; HRBackend</code></pre>
<p>What this does is create a <strong>composite function</strong> that takes a Search and passes it to both the backends. It then takes the results and appends them together (because SearchResult is a Monoid).</p>
<p>This means that from the point of view of the program, there is only <strong>one</strong> backend. You can add as many as you want, it will all look just like one backend, a simple Monoid of type (Search -&gt; SearchResult). This will hold up even when the company merges with another.</p>
<pre><code>ourBackend = SWEnggBackend &lt;&gt; HRBackend &lt;&gt; ...

theirBackend = FooBackend &lt;&gt; BarBackend &lt;&gt; ...

backend = ourBackend &lt;&gt; theirBackend</code></pre>
<p>No part of your program has to change with all the other changes. You don’t have to add the complexity of having a list of backends and then processing them manually. In fact, each of those backends could themselves encompass several other backends about which you need know nothing.</p>
<p>To your program, there is just one backend. At each point, you’re dealing with just <strong>one</strong> composite backend. The code complexity of your program stays constant no matter how many backends you add.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg with category theory. There’s still free monads, coyoneda (free functor), monad transformers, adjoints, and all this other neat stuff.</p>

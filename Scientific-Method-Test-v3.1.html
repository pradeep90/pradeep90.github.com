<h1 id="scientific-method-v3.1">Scientific Method v3.1</h1>
<p>Resource: The Will Power Instinct, by Kelly McGonigal</p>
<p>Mission: Summarize the Introduction chapter of the book.</p>
<p>Let’s use my v3.0 algorithm: Identify key variables, get some evidence, generate alternative models.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-one-i-will-i-wont-i-want">Chapter One: I Will, I Won’t, I Want</h1>
<p>We have multiple selves and this causes willpower challenges when their interests conflict.</p>
<p>Variables: what we think, feel, and do; willpower challenge (assume you can identify this independently); how easy an action feels.</p>
<p>Willpower challenge is caused by conflicting interests between your multiple selves.</p>
<p>What you actually do in a willpower challenge depends on your self-awareness and self-control.</p>
<p>How easy it is to do something depends on how strong your self-awareness and self-control systems are. What about your motivation for that action?</p>
<p>How do we observe or manipulate these “multiple selves” and their interests? What are some other effects of these multiple selves?</p>
<h2 id="evidence">Evidence</h2>
<p>Hypothesis from neuroscience: I will, I won’t, and I want in the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>I will: Whether you start and stick to boring, difficult, or stressful tasks depends on a region near the upper left side of the PFC.</p>
<p>I won’t: Whether you follow an impulse or craving depends on the right side of your PFC.</p>
<p>So, what you do depends on the I will and I won’t parts of your PFC.</p>
<p>“How motivated” you are to take action or resist temptation depends on how rapidly the cells fire in the I want region of your PFC. (Not clear how this is different from the dopamine system.)</p>
<p>Question: What does your I want system do? What does it cause? We care about actions and those are decided by your I will and I won’t systems.</p>
<p>Hypothesis from neuroscience: Two minds - one that goes after immediate gratification, and another that goes for long-term goals.</p>
<p>Variable: do you choose an action that gives you immediate gratification or one that serves your long-term goals?</p>
<p>Intervention: The Phineas Gage accident. Accident -&gt; lost his will power, his won’t power, and his want power.</p>
<p>Intervention: Young woman who lost part of her midbrain and could apparently no longer feel fear or disgust. So, whether you can feel fear or disgust depends on that part of your midbrain.</p>
<p>Hypothesis from neuroscience: two minds - immediate gratification vs long-term goals.</p>
<p>Intervention: High price tag feels like a punch to the gut.</p>
<p>Your actions depends on whether you recognize that you’re making a choice that requires willpower. If you don’t recognize this, you won’t be able to apply willpower. So, actually, whether you can apply willpower depends on whether you’re aware of what you’re doing.</p>
<p>Correlation: How many food-related decisions do you think you make? People are unaware of a lot of choices they made. That is, we have a correlation between actual #choices and aware #choices. Also, awareness came after the choices were available. So, either the #choices made you unaware or something else caused the #aware choices. What decides the #choices you will be aware of? I think the #total choices plays a role, and also how occupied you are.</p>
<p>Intervention: Distracting people makes them give in more (to immediate gratification). So, your actions depend on whether you’re distracted (in which case they will be guided by your impulses). Willpower depends on awareness which depends on whether you’re distracted.</p>
<p>Intervention: Neuroplasticity. Exercising particular functions of your brain make them grow stronger. So, how good you are at some skill depends on how much gray area is in that part of your brain, which depends on how much experience you’ve had.</p>
<p>Intervention: Meditation makes your brain better at a wide range of self-control skills. self-control skills (like self-awareness and willpower) depend on the neurons in those brain regions, which depend on how much meditation you’ve done.</p>
<p>Intervention: How little meditation is required for changes. For improvement in self-control skills, a few hours of meditation or eight weeks of meditation show results.</p>

<h1 id="key-question-explain-boundaries-logically">Key Question: Explain boundaries logically?</h1>
<p>One of the things that struck me most after reading Boundaries was the idea that you could explain to a friend the boundaries they were violating and not get hurt even more. Like if they were constantly putting you down, you could explain that you didn’t like that and ask them to stop. And if they didn’t stop, you could choose to stop associating with them.</p>
<p>But now that I’m learning about how the brain works and how we apparently make decisions based on our gut feeling about a person and not logical reasons, is that point still valid?</p>
<p>In other words, is it safe to make it clear to a person that they’re hurting you with their behaviour? Or will that just lead to even more hurt (teasing, etc.)?</p>
<p>It’s all fine to commit to walking away from them if they keep mistreating you, but what if you need that social network? What if you want to be part of that group?</p>
<p>My current answer is that you have to decide how much it is worth to you. If you get more benefits from the group than from being free of abuse, then you should probably stay.</p>
<p>Of course, I suspect that this is a false dilemma. There are probably other actions you could take. Is it possible to stay within a group where people mistreat you and not lose your self-respect?</p>
<p>Wait. No. My actual question is this: is it possible to stop people from mistreating you? Is it possible to make them stop thinking of you as some loser and always pointing out your faults, or otherwise treating your time and opinions as having no value? I guess the answer is not really. They can do whatever they want with their property - like thinking you’re a loser, etc. However, they can’t infringe on your property - wasting your time, spoiling your outings by making fun of you, dismissing your dearly-held opinions, etc.</p>

<h1 id="congruence">Congruence</h1>
<p>Question: When do we find ourselves having an undesirable identity? When do we do things we disrespect and neglect things we respect?</p>
<p>In other words, when are we congruent?</p>
<p>(Decide your identity.)</p>
<p>Undesirable behaviour is due to a weak identity.</p>
<h1 id="losing-your-identity">Losing your Identity</h1>
<p>Observation: When I talk to my grandmother or some other elders, I automatically end up talking about stuff I’m not interested in - stuff like my appearance or job prospects or material purchases (or lack thereof) or even marriage. And since I hardly put any efforts in these areas, I feel like a loser by the end of the conversation.</p>
<p>What happens? None of those things are part of my identity. (More on this in later posts.) But I still end up feeling unworthy.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: When you talk to somebody you respect, you take on part of their identity and leave your own.</p>
<p>Specifically, I think this happens because when you talk to somebody you respect, you don’t (or can’t) tell them to shut up and change the topic. You keep going along with their flow out of respect. Therefore, you end up talking about (and thus paying attention to) only stuff that <em>they</em> care about. And we all know what attention does to our rules - it changes them. If they praise you for something, you feel good because you’re paying attention to the praise even if it’s for something you don’t want to care about (like your looks or skin tone or university). And if they mock you, you feel bad even when you don’t care about your lack of cars or “marital bliss”.</p>
<p>Lesson: Either don’t talk to people who you respect blindly (because then their identity will be different from yours and they will impose it on you) or don’t let anyone talk to you about stuff that is not in your identity.</p>
<h1 id="conversation">Conversation</h1>
<p>Corollary: Conversation is a major weapon for identity change.</p>
<p>Be careful how you allot the attention you both pay to things. That is the path for real-life inception.</p>
<p>For example, I was talking to someone recently about how I got a wallet cover for my phone so that I could keep my debit cards and a bit of cash right along with my phone. This is a pretty neat way to reduce the junk I have to carry everywhere, I thought. I’m going to carry my phone everywhere; now I don’t need to worry about having an additional wallet.</p>
<p>However, my friend mocked me by saying “So, if you lose your phone, you lose everything! Ha ha ha.” I argued that we were all switching to a highly cashless society and that my way was the way of the future and that I would find it more convenient. I had done that for a year with no untoward incident, plus neither I nor anybody I knew had ever lost a phone, so the risk was minimal.</p>
<p>What could I have done to win the argument? Or was he right? Should I use an additional wallet after all?</p>
<p><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /></p>
<p>WRONG QUESTION! The correct question is: Who cares?</p>
<p>It really isn’t a big deal at all. But by talking about it for a full five minutes, we made it into a match where if I “won” the argument I would get rewarded with pride and he would get punished with shame, and vice versa. By getting it mixed up with our self-worth, we made it into a big deal. It therefore became a matter of national security to make the most convincing argument about a silly little phone cover.</p>
<p>But the extra little risk and inconvenience of losing my phone and cards really isn’t part of my identity. I should have just done what I liked with my phone and debit cards and gone on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m1s2NFOGyg">focussing on science</a>.</p>
<p>Corollary: Any time you find yourself arguing about minutiae, stop and check whether it’s really part of your identity.</p>
<hr />
<p>Further example: Dad and 69 kg.</p>
<p>(Observation: Man, it’s so obvious now! Earlier, I used to scratch my head at why I could focus on my true values when I was alone but got sucked into others’ values the moment I rejoined society.)</p>
<p>Observation: Talking to family members about my new home, whether things are comfortable, pictures of the scenery, etc. I don’t give a fuck about these things.</p>
<h1 id="external-influences">External Influences</h1>
<p>Observation: After a romantic movie, feel like a life without a loving girlfriend is a waste.</p>
<p>I’ve been reinforcing those rules.</p>
<p>Observation: After a season of some romantic sitcom, I feel like I should have the female lead as my girlfriend.</p>
<p>(The rest of the world can burn for all I care.)</p>
<h1 id="control-your-environment">Control your Environment</h1>
<p>Hypothesis: How to make sure you think <em>only</em> about X? Make that the only thing in your environment.</p>
<p>For example, <a href>turn off</a> the internet, clear the other books and papers from your desk, and if possible clear the rest of the room of anything else that might distract you. The internet, in its role as the purveyor of novel stimuli, is the biggest culprit. In effect, have a dedicated study room.</p>
<h1 id="congruent-actions">Congruent Actions</h1>
<p>(<strong>TODO</strong>: check previous section.)</p>
<p>Acting in line with your identity.</p>
<p>I feel like I’m drinking some elixir of deep thought when I write essays. I’ve acted exactly in line with my identity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when I look back on my day after a long binge of YouTube, I feel disgust.</p>
<h1 id="commitment-and-consistency">Commitment and Consistency</h1>
<p>Hypothesis: This is how commitment and consistency works.</p>

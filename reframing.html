<h1 id="reframing">Reframing</h1>
<p>I’ve been riding around town on my high-school bicycle for the last few months. One old man who saw me kept ridiculing me by saying “Why do you keep going around on this stupid bicycle? Why don’t you buy a motorbike and go around in style?” (implying that I wasn’t rich enough to own a motorbike). I felt bad about it for a while. But my values are different from his! For him, riding a bicycle is a badge of shame, a sign that you are too poor to buy a motorbike or a car. For me, a bicycle is just a means of exercising without having to stay in a sterile, sweaty indoor gym. Whether I can afford a motorbike or not is “an unwanted statement irrelevant to the current situation”.</p>
<p>In other words, I shouldn’t have let the ridicule get to me since it wasn’t in line with my values. However, that’s not something you can choose. Identity rules. If owning a motorbike is part of your identity, then not owning one will cause you shame. So, the only way to not feel ashamed about riding my bicycle is by eliminating the motorbike rule.</p>
<p>That begs the question: how do you get rid of a rule? Conversely, how do you install a new rule?</p>
<p>We’ve seen that punishment is how you weaken a rule. Similarly, praise and negative reinforcement is how you strengthen a rule.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, we’ve come to the set of rules currently in our identity. Now, we need to take the wheel and point our car in the direction we want. That means strengthening <em>only</em> the rules in our desired identity and weakening the rest.</p>
<p>What am I doing instead? What am I rewarding and what am I punishing?</p>
<p>Observation: By paying attention to people who talk about my appearance, I accept their rewards or punishment about my looks and clothes. Therefore, I strengthen the rules that say looking good is important (and looking scruffy is bad).</p>
<p>Observation: By watching YouTube videos about nonsense, I reward the rules that say “having fun” is good. By yearning for videos when I’m bored, I negatively reinforce the rule that watching videos is the best thing ever and nothing else can come close.</p>
<p>(Note that, like I mentioned in <a href="./turn-off-the-internet.html">Turn off the Internet</a>, I hardly ever yearn for YouTube videos when I’m in the middle of a programming project. So, by working hard on my program, I reinforce the rule that programming well is what matters in life and other things can go to hell.)</p>
<p>Observation: By hardly ever using the scientific method or hardly ever looking for empirical evidence, I’m weakening the rule that scientific thinking is awesome and every other form of thinking is inferior.</p>
<p>Therefore, I don’t feel bad when I take very long to solve a problem (as happens when you don’t think scientifically) or when I neglect empirical information about my writing progress.</p>
<p>Observation: By checking my weight and body fat every week, I reward fat loss and punish fat gain. That strengthens the rule that having a lot of fat is bad.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: Punishment isn’t the only way to weaken a rule. Neglect works too.</p>
<h1 id="attention">Attention</h1>
<p>Given that neglect weakens rules, we should suspect that attention will strengthen rules.</p>
<p>Observation: In the above bike-riding example, the old man kept bringing my attention to the fact that I was riding an old bicycle and the “fact” that I wasn’t rich (as far as he knew). And since being poor is not exactly worthy of respect in my mind, I felt bad. In fact, I was conscious every time I passed that man’s shop when biking.</p>
<p>Notice that my attention <em>wasn’t</em> on the fact that I was doing cardio for an hour every single day and burning fat while others were packing on fat like it was on sale. I was making tremendous progress according to my own values, but my attention didn’t go anywhere near that. All I kept thinking was that this man thought I was poor and thus I was unworthy of respect.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: Paying attention to praise or ridicule is what makes it a reward or punishment.</p>
<p>This explains why people can do the same thing yet come away feeling differently. For example, when somebody shows me their shiny new smartphone with the latest x-inch screen and y-mAh battery and whatever adjective-packed features (“20MP Moonlight camera for perfect selfie”), we both have vastly different opinions. They prance around in (fleeting) joy about their newly-acquired status symbol whereas I shake my head at the fact that they’ve wasted a full 50% of their pre-tax monthly salary on something that works no better than their previous perfectly-functional smartphone, while their student loans and car EMIs keep mounting.</p>
<p>They’re focussing on the brand-new action-packed smartphone part, which flatters their rule that “own latest smartphone =&gt; awesome”, while I’m focussing on the “some people just want to watch their financial world burn” part, which ties into my rule that “buy junk when you have debt =&gt; full retard”.</p>
<p>It’s a vicious cycle. For them, thinking about their financial situation is painful, whereas thinking about their awesome new smartphone is a point of pride. For me, thinking about the “awesome” new smartphone, while still fun, just provokes more guilt about the money I’ve wasted, whereas the sensible financial decisions I’ve made are much more rewarding. Because we both avoid pain and seek pleasure, they end up with a stronger identity of a latest-smartphone owner, while I end up with a stronger identity of a fiscally-prudent man.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lesson: To reinforce your desired identity, pay attention only to the aspects that are in your identity.</p>
<p>This involves reinterpreting or <em>reframing</em> any event as per your own identity. Focus on the daily cardio, not the old cheap-looking bicycle. Notice the mounting debt, not the soon-to-become-obsolete latest smartphone. Concentrate on your lack of practice, not on the “fun” you get from the internet.</p>

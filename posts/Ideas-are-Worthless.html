<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: The most important thing is to remember all the great ideas we’ve come across, right?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="facing-the-heat">Facing the heat</h1>
<p>In “<a href="./The-Big-Problems.html">The Big Problems</a>” yesterday, we saw some of the important problems that we need to solve and fast. Let’s take on the problem of the <a href="./Why-write-Blog-posts.html#leaky-buckets">Leaky Bucket</a>. I am, of course, talking about our mind and how it smoothly forgets important ideas over time.</p>
<p>What I just realized is that patching up the leaks in our mind is not enough. Nowhere near enough.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<h1 id="the-to-do-list-strikes-back">The To-Do List strikes back</h1>
<p>Assume I give you an epic awesome tool that ensures that you remember every single important thing every single day. You remember all the epiphanies you’ve had and their chains of logic are clear in your mind.</p>
<p>Is that all? Are we happy? Nah.</p>
<p>We want to actually take action on these ideas.</p>
<p>When writing about the problem of our Leaky Buckets, I had some inkling of a solution that would help us remember all the important ideas and much more. You had to put in a little bit of effort, but that solution would give you guaranteed results.</p>
<p>But assume I use that tool and load all the important ideas in my head as I move around life. Does this mean I will utilize all of them and never falter? Hell no! How do I know that? Cos, even though I forget the hundred ideas I have come across, I do have three or four ideas in my mind. Good ones, too, if they have stuck in my head.</p>
<p>What came of them? Just from the past two weeks, I’ve written about the dangers of easy access to lots of resources through piracy, about drama, about backlogs, about Will Power, about sleeping early… and I still haven’t done too much about any of them.</p>
<p>Basically, I have a list of ideas that I need to take action on - plans, if you will - and I’ve done nothing about any of them. Does that ring a bell?</p>
<p>Yup. You got it. It’s our old arch-nemesis, the To-Do List!</p>
<h1 id="a-perfect-memory-isnt-the-solution">A perfect memory isn’t the solution</h1>
<p>All the ideas I have accumulated form an <em>implicit</em> To-Do List. This is what I was talking about in the <a href="./Fie-on-your-TODO-List.html">To-Do List essay</a>.</p>
<p>And with that come all the drawbacks of the To-Do List. Will Power Depletion means that it is unlikely that we will achieve any of them. Plus, it is very likely that we won’t finish our To-Do List. Ever. But the items are still <em>on</em> the To-Do List. Which means we will keep feeling <em>bad</em> about not having accomplished what we want to do. We will keep beating ourselves up for not living up to our potential.</p>
<p>Simply remembering all the ideas and keeping them in front of you is not the solution. As a trivial example, you could keep some sort of small card in your wallet that contained all the ideas you have come across and you could look at it everyday. So what? The ideas aren’t the bottleneck! Actions are!</p>
<p>Yo! You’ve written about this <a href="./The-Big-Problems.html#ask-not-what-rationality-can-do-for-you">in the last post</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Akrasia is the bottleneck in the process of getting the Impact we want to see. We have buttloads of awesome ideas. It is in the execution that we falter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to repeat: Ideas are not the Bottleneck! Actions are.</p>
<p>Which means the next time someone tries to unload some more “ideas” on you saying that “it’s gonna change your life”, you bust a cap in their ass.</p>
<h1 id="ideas-are-worthless">Ideas are worthless</h1>
<p>F*ck! This ties in perfectly with what PG says about startup ideas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think this is often the case. I think people believe that coming up with ideas for startups is very hard– that it must be very hard– and so they don’t try do to it. They assume ideas are like miracles: they either pop into your head or they don’t.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><em>Actually, startup ideas are not million dollar ideas, and here’s an experiment you can try to prove it: just try to sell one.</em> Nothing evolves faster than markets. The fact that there’s no market for startup ideas suggests there’s no demand. Which means, in the narrow sense of the word, that <em>startup ideas are worthless</em>.</p>
<p>– Paul Graham, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ideas.html">Ideas for Startups</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ideas (alone) are worthless! The only people making money off ideas are <del>frauds</del> self-development gurus. And it is only now that I can admit that only dumbasses read those books or buy their overpriced “seminar” videos and stuff.</p>
<p>Seriously, if you want to know the sum total of all human knowledge about how to live a good life, you can go read the top-selling, best-rated self-help books on Amazon. And then come back. There will be absolutely no change in your life. Guaranteed.</p>
<p>Ditto for this website with all its “essays” and “ideas” and stuff. Utter crap.</p>
<p>Okay. You probably knew that on some level beforehand. What’s new?</p>
<p>Well, the conclusion is that it is almost utterly useless to read any more books. That awesome new book on Psychology and how it can apply to your life. Useless. Don’t read it. THAT new book on how to increase your Will Power. Pretty much useless. Don’t read it.</p>
<p>You want data? Look at your own life. Look at other people’s lives.</p>
<p>Stop waiting for a book or blog post to come along that will change your life significantly. Nah. Not gonna happen. And don’t just stop there. Go further. Stop reading books. It’s not doing anything for you (pretty much). This is why we have the <a href="./Low-Information-Diet.html">Low-Information Diet</a>.</p>
<p>If Ideas are worthless, then what is the point of remembering the list of ideas you’ve had? Rhetorical.</p>
<h1 id="an-unexpected-boon">An Unexpected Boon</h1>
<p>In fact, if I’m right in saying that all the great ideas I have form an implicit To-Do List, then it is actually a boon that we forget most of them. If not, imagine how crappy you’d feel all the time! You know about A, and B, and C, …, and X, and Y, and Z and you’ve still done nothing! You suck!</p>
<p>F*ck! That is actually cheering news. I hadn’t realized this before (dumbass… I know). In fact, this is why I sounded so critical and despondent in my posts of late. I kept thinking about all the ideas I knew of and all the action I had <em>not</em> taken and I kept beating myself up.</p>
<p>So, not only would it be worthless to remember all the ideas we have ever had, it would actually hamper us like hell. Cool. In fact, this suggests we should actively stop ourselves from remembering all our ideas. Why? Cos No Impact, No Right to Beat Yourself Up. If you have don’t get any Impact even after remembering all the ideas, then you have no right to curse yourself for being a dumbass when you forget them. It would have been the same either way.</p>
<p>All that is fine and dandy, but it still leaves us where we started. How do we speed up progress? How do we tackle the <a href="./The-Big-Problems.html">Big Problems</a>? How do we make Ideas <em>not</em> be worthless?</p>
<p>(to be continued)</p>
<h1 id="ps">PS</h1>
<p>The main realization here was that even a perfect memory isn’t going to do much for me in the area of ideas. I had been beating myself (and everybody else) up for having forgotten important ideas we had come across. I was working under the impression that that was a major bottleneck. As it stands, all those great ideas are best forgotten. No use remembering them.</p>
<p>Note, of course, that there is a place for a good memory and effective organization of facts. That is in learning. You need to have an accurate and rich mental model if you want to become master-class in anything challenging. So I <em>will</em> get to use that spiffy awesome tool I was talking about earlier. But that is a topic for another essay.</p>

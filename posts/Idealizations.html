<p><strong>Entry question</strong>:</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="prelude">Prelude</h1>
<p>I’ve been sitting at my computer for the last 15 minutes trying to write the next post in the Hard Problems series.</p>
<p>And coming up with nothing.</p>
<p>Absolute blank. No sudden insights. No sudden flash of understanding.</p>
<p>This is unusual for me. I usually get going from the first word when I sit down at night for my daily dose of 300W.</p>
<p>Then, I thought - “Yeah, well… I <em>am</em> rather distracted by other stuff right now (<em>*cough*</em> IPL match <em>*cough*</em>).”</p>
<p>Then, a familiar voice came up in my mind involuntarily - “You’re watching <em>IPL</em>?!!”. The imagined sentence from an imaginary friend dripped with disbelief and condescension.</p>
<p>That’s my friend and co-conspirator, a certain Mr. Special Agent.</p>
<p>Then, the thought came up - Why does he get so upset and vindictive when he discovers stuff like that about me?</p>
<p>Surprise is cool. A bit of friendly chiding is fine and healthy too, I guess. Why does it affect him so visibly, though?</p>
<h1 id="questions">Questions</h1>
<p>Duh.</p>
<p>Why do we get all disappointed when we watch interviews of our favourite celebrities and discover that in some ways they are actually pretty retarded?</p>
<p>Why did I get all riled up when people made fun of the great Albus Dumbledore for no reason at all?</p>
<p>Why do you get dumb-founded when you discover that the girl you desperately love is just another person, silly in some ways, ok in others, good in some ways, all in all just a normal human being?</p>
<p>What do we mean by “disappointed”?</p>
<p>It means something didn’t hold up to the expectations we had of it.</p>
<p>It’s like we had a model of it and the reality didn’t hold up to the model. And that’s why we felt sad. And pissed off. Reality fell short.</p>
<h1 id="idealizations">Idealizations</h1>
<p>What’s the problem if I slack off once in a while?</p>
<p>What’s the problem if <em>I</em> (the guy who says processed food like Maggi is bad for you) goes off and has Maggi pretty regularly?</p>
<p>Friendly concern is one thing.</p>
<p>The real problem is that he - and most of us - are living in the world of Ideals.</p>
<p>The <em>ideal</em> student of Rationality wouldn’t do crap stuff like effing watch <strong>IPL</strong>, for god damn’s sake.</p>
<p>The <em>ideal</em> student of Rationality wouldn’t do shitty stuff like eating a burger for lunch. With french fries. Holy mother of God! And a pizza for lunch the next day. And four batata vadas for dessert the day after that. What’s this world coming to?</p>
<p>Let’s try to imagine the life and times of the aforementioned <em>ideal</em> student of Rationality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Wake up at 6am everyday</p></li>
<li><p>Do yoga. Then, meditation. Better yet, yoga with meditation. Then, 30m of cardio. Then, think about your goals in life. Then, think about your goals for the day. Then, write your to-do list for the day. On a smart-phone app, so that it is synced with the smart-devices in your shoelace and your underwear.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, eat high-protein, low-fat, low-calorie, high-fibre, high-energy breakfast very slowly so that you feel full for longer.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, write one post of 300 words.</p>
<p>Write an introduction that captivates people. Then, write four paragraphs after that, each of which have ground-breaking mind-blowing insane-awesome super-exclusive you-heard-it-first-here-on-NDTV concepts. In such a funny manner that Chris Brown starts reading your site everyday to get inspiration. And in such a poetic manner that the Nobel Prize for Literature seriously consider allowing blogs to be nominated. And in such a motherf*cking rational manner that people who already believe you get an orgasm and go into cardiac arrest from the thrill of reading your post. People who didn’t believe you earlier become true believers and start wearing “Rationality Rocks” t-shirt to work. Or become blind and die of syphilis. Whichever is easier.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, go to work. Exactly on time. The same time you came yesterday. And the day before that. And the 220 days before that. Do kickass work. Show them the true meaning of Rationality.</p></li>
<li><p>And so it goes…</p></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="so-what">So what?</h1>
<p>What’s wrong with that?</p>
<p>What’s wrong with aiming for the skies, shooting for the moon?</p>
<p>Isn’t it good to have a model of what you’re aiming for and stuff?</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<hr />
<p>Name three people or things you think are near-perfect in certain areas.</p>
<p>Could be any areas - cricket, music, acting, comedy, chess, parenting, singing, whatever.</p>
<hr />
<p>What really is wrong with thinking that Dhoni is this utterly calm, inhumanly cool cucumber who <em>never</em> shakes under pressure?</p>
<p>What’s wrong with thinking that AR Rahman is the god of music who <em>always</em> puts out hit albums?</p>
<p>Or that Sachin Tendulkar is, was, and will be the best batsman <em>ever</em> - f*ck you, Brian, Vivian, Rahul, Ricky, Sunil, and Don?</p>
<h1 id="how-do-we-identify-idealizations">How do we identify idealizations?</h1>
<p>Coming soon.</p>
<p>Btw, a person who is trying to become more rational should <em>never</em> get swayed by emotions.</p>
<p>He should <em>always</em> keep his end goal in mind and do whatever is right - f*ck you, puny humans who get limited by their feelings.</p>
<p>I don’t want to give you any <em>hints</em> about identifying idealizations. I mean, a rational thinker should <em>never</em> need any hints or guidance from others. He should <em>always</em> just get it all by himself.</p>
<h1 id="okay-see-ya-tomorrow">Okay, see ya tomorrow</h1>
<p>Yo!</p>
<p>Wait!</p>
<p>You never did say why idealizations are bad.</p>
<p>Well. What world do we live in?</p>
<p>The world of truth. The world of ordinary reality.</p>
<p>Ain’t no fairy-tale world. Ain’t no God / Mani Ratnam writing the script.</p>
<p>Can Dhoni ever give you the pleasure of seeing that he has improved by miles in his handling of tough situations?</p>
<p>Nope. Cos in your mind, he is already the perfect cool cucumber.</p>
<p>Can he ever <em>exceed your expectations</em>?</p>
<p>What happen when someone can never exceed your expectations?</p>
<p>They either meet your expectations or disappoint you.</p>
<p>You can never be joyfully surprised.</p>
<p>But all these arguments are about you. What about that person?</p>
<p>No matter what he does, it will <strong>never</strong> be enough! He is fighting a losing battle.</p>
<p>Imagine rolling a huge boulder up a hill. You struggle for days and get it up to the top. You stop to take a breath and it rolls back down the other side. (see: Sisyphus)</p>
<p>You will never feel happy. Never joyful.</p>
<h1 id="raising-the-stakes">Raising the stakes</h1>
<p>Hmmm… sounds pretty bad. Maybe we shouldn’t be <a href="./Being-Judgemental-and-being-Low-self-esteem.html">judging</a> them too much. But, come on, it’s pretty harmless. It could even be like motivation for them to do better and stuff.</p>
<p>One can only conclude that you know batshit about humans and human motivation. Doing a never-satisfying and thankless job is pretty f*cking far from a human’s dream.</p>
<p>Let me up the stakes a bit more.</p>
<p>What if that person were someone you cared about very much?</p>
<p>What if you have a lot of idealizations about… gasp… yourself?!</p>
<p>“I need to sleep everyday before 12 midnight. A <em>rational</em> thinker would sleep early <em>every single</em> night. Why am I such a loser?”</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>More coming soon.</p>

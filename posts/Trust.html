<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This is going to be an uncharacteristically personal post. Much of it won’t make sense to you because you don’t know me and I’m writing it while I’m fresh on all the emotions that overcame me. But, f*ck it, I’ve just had an epiphany and I’m allowed to write damn well what I want.</p>
<h2 id="mistrust">Mistrust</h2>
<p>Today, my friends could have possibly changed the course of my entire life.</p>
<p>For the last 6 months, I had pretty much given up on social contact.</p>
<p>I was rather intimidated by one friend, afraid to share anything with him, afraid that he would make fun of me in some way and make me feel really bad.</p>
<p>I was rather pissed off at another friend, a long-time companion on various Paths. He hadn’t been in touch much, and had broken some commitments with me (yo, where are the two blog posts you said you would write?).</p>
<p>So, I was like, “I’m giving up all this social crap. Nothing but a bunch of trouble.”</p>
<h2 id="the-confrontation-that-never-happened">The confrontation that never happened</h2>
<p>Anyway, so this second friend, let’s call him CTW, called up out of nowhere suggesting that we should catch up this weekend.</p>
<p>I was already pretty vexed about the whole situation with him. The last few times I had spoken to him, he had seemed kind of unresponsive and disinterested. Every time I spoke to him, I felt like he was being kinda rude or snide for no particular reason.</p>
<p>There was a time, two years ago, when we were making rapid progress in our individual paths of self-improvement and critical thinking and whatnot. Every single time we met, we used to come up with some new insights, some new techniques, some more motivation, and a whole lot of energy.</p>
<p>It was like we were lifting each other up every time we met. Maybe it was the carried-over fervour of our religious adventures in the past, but we were really pumped up about life and shit in general. It was a delight and honour to have that meeting with him on the roof-top every Sunday evening. Every time, I walked away with renewed vigour and optimism about our future.</p>
<p>People in the self-development area have this concept called The Mastermind Group. This dates back to, I think, old gurus like Norman Vincent Peale or whoever. The idea is that you make sure to hang around with people whom you admire and respect and want to emulate. You fill your mind with thoughts and ideas from these people as much as possible. And, pretty soon, you’ll achieve results as good as them and go further ahead on your path than you would if you were all alone or with indifferent friends.</p>

<p>“But you are the average of the five people you associate with most, so do not underestimate the effects of your pessimistic, unambitious, or disorganized friends. If someone isn’t making you stronger, they’re making you weaker.” - Timothy Ferriss, The 4-Hour Work Week</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s pretty controversial, I guess, but hey!</p>
<p>That was two years ago. Then…</p>

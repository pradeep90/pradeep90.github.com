<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: <em>How</em> do we make super-accurate predictions?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="example">Example</h1>
<p>Say we want to predict how much time a ball will take to reach the ground when dropped from some height.</p>
<p>Person A goes to apartments on different floors of a tall building. He drops the ball from each balcony and notes down the time taken each time. He compiles this huge table of height vs time taken.</p>
<p>So now, if you ask him how long it takes to reach the ground from 20m high (aka 10 floors high), he looks at the table and predicts that it should take 2s. We test it out and it is correct.</p>
<p>Person B is a bit smarter. He reads up a basic physics textbook. He says time taken = square root of (2 * h / g). You put 20m in the formula and you get 2s. That’s his prediction. Correct.</p>
<h1 id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</h1>
<p>A and B used different Hypotheses to make their prediction. A’s hypothesis was that the time taken would be the same as the times he had recorded in his table. B’s hypothesis was that the time taken was square root of (2 * h / g).</p>
<p>A hypothesis is something that tells you what predictions to make.</p>
<p>Using their hypotheses, A and B could make predictions for different heights - 4m, 8m, whatever. And they are both right.</p>
<p>We give a hypothesis the current event and it tells us its predictions for the various outcomes. That’s all hypotheses do. They are prediction-making machines.</p>
<p>For our purposes here, we can take a Hypothesis to be a computer program that outputs the predictions we need.</p>
<p>So, from the point of view of <a href="./The-Prediction-Game.html">Prediction Score Maximizing</a>, what we want is to discover a Hypothesis that will make correct predictions.</p>
<h1 id="occams-razor">Occam’s Razor</h1>
<p>Which of the two Hypotheses do you find more appealing? The table of observations or the formula?</p>
<p>Well, if you want to know things like time taken when dropped from height 2.74m, things get real iffy with the table hypothesis. Now, you need a lot more observations. The more precision you want, and the more events you want to predict, the more data you will need. That table will be a big fat one if you want it to be useful at all times.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the formula will remain short and sweet and simple no matter how much precision you demand or how many different events you want to predict.</p>
<p>Humans consider simpler Hypotheses to be more true than more complex ones. This is called <strong>Occam’s Razor</strong>.</p>
<p>If a theory can explain all the current evidence with fewer assumptions than another, we will go with that one. Why bring in unnecessary elements? Why use a huge table full of seemingly unrelated data when one simple formula explains everything?</p>
<h1 id="complexity">Complexity</h1>
<p>More precisely, the Complexity of a hypothesis measures the difficulty of describing <em>how</em> to compute the predictions. For our purposes, Complexity is basically the size of the computer program we would need to write to describe the Hypothesis.</p>
<p>Occam’s Razor says that, between hypotheses that make correct predictions for the data, we prefer the one with least Complexity.</p>
<p>For example, to describe the table Hypothesis above, we would need to describe every entry in that table to our computer program. Not cool. Such a long program.</p>
<p>To describe the formula, it’s just a single line of code (roughly speaking).</p>
<p>The formula wins, by Occam’s Razor.</p>
<p>So, let’s change our wish: We want a hypothesis that will make the right predictions, but preferably with lower complexity.</p>
<p>Aim: Simplify your Hypothesis while maintaining the Prediction Power.</p>
<h1 id="good-hypotheses-capture-the-underlying-structure">Good Hypotheses capture the underlying structure</h1>
<p>How can you make Hypotheses simpler without losing out on Prediction Power?</p>
<p>You can discover the underlying causal structure of the events you’re predicting.</p>
<p>If you know that Earth’s gravitational force pulls bodies on the surface with a force of mass * g, then you can use that to derive the formula for time taken to reach the ground for a dropped ball.</p>
<p>You don’t have to describe messy calculations for different heights and all. You now know how the thing <em>actually</em> works. Describe exactly how it works. That will be the simplest description and it will also be correct, so you will end up winning according to Occam’s Razor.</p>
<p>This includes stuff like “doing A causes B to happen” (e.g., punching you in the face cause black eye to happen, eating lots of ice-cream makes you fat, smoking gives you lung cancer) and so on.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>We want good hypotheses - high Predictive Power, low Complexity. Things that capture the underlying causal structure of the world.</p>
<p>How do we discover good hypotheses? Coming Soon.</p>

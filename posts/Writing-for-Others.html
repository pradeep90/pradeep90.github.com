<!-- TODO -->
<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: Whom should you write for?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="writing-for-others">Writing for others</h2>
<p>Why am I writing about this again? Didn’t I figure this stuff out in <a href="./Portrait-of-the-Writer-as-an-Ignorant-Fool.html">Portrait</a> and <a href="./The-Double-Edged-Sword-of-Essays.html">the Double-Edged Sword</a>?</p>
<p>So, here’s what happened. I wrote “<a href="./Why-take-the-high-road.html">Why take the High Road?</a>” late at night on Saturday and then went to sleep. However, there was this nagging feeling at the back of my mind. I was definitely <em>not</em> happy. Usually, after writing each day’s essay, I go to bed feeling really happy and satisfied. I usually feel like I have given it everything I have.</p>
<p>It’s not just that. Everyday, I feel like I have gained a lot from the process of writing. I get at least one or two insights from each day’s post. That’s par for the course. I connect a few ideas in my head, generate a couple more, and get reminded of old ideas that have slipped through the holes in my leaky bucket.</p>
<p>But on Saturday night, there was nothing. I hadn’t gained anything at all. I had just written out stuff that I knew pretty clearly in my head. I had a pretty good idea of why I should take the High Road as I was writing about <a href="./Revenge-or-Grow.html">Revenge or Grow</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-this-mean">What does this mean?</h2>
<p>Don’t write stuff for others? That seems to be indicated.</p>
<p>Wait. Let’s look at the problem in more detail.</p>
<p>I feel like I’m not growing stronger after writing certain essays. I don’t find much value being directly added to my life. I don’t see any new paths for improvement from writing that essay.</p>
<p>But is that the only reason to write? Aren’t we also writing to spread some ideas, get them peer-reviewed and tested out in the open, and learn from the process?</p>
<p>I think I had failed to keep to the 20:1 benefit ratio I talked about earlier. I need to be getting way more value from each essay than the audience does. Otherwise, I feel like I’m not making any progress at all and that there’s no point at all in writing.</p>
<p>Is it because I don’t have any other feedback mechanism except for the number of insights I have for my own life? Could it be better if I could get feedback from others about whether or not any of my ideas were right or helpful?</p>
<h2 id="thats-a-pretty-good-point">That’s a pretty good point</h2>
<p>Ok. I admit it. Maybe that is the reason why I got so disheartened on Saturday night. It seemed that all those words were for no use at all. I literally felt like I was making very little “progress in life” [citation needed][essay needed].</p>
<p>Cool. So, what happened was that it <em>felt to my mind</em> that there was no impact happening anywhere in the world, either within myself or in others, because of my essay. Why? Cos I couldn’t see any impact. There was no feedback. And there won’t be, cos ain’t no one taking action on my essays (including le author). So, naturally, it felt like there was just no good reason to write such essays.</p>
<p>How can I remedy that?</p>
<p>I had mentioned in <a href="./Portrait-of-the-Writer-as-an-Ignorant-Fool.html">Portrait</a> that, from here onwards, I was gonna write <strong>only</strong> for myself, not to convince others. The reason was that by writing for others I was losing sight of the million areas in which I needed to improve my own thinking.</p>
<p>That could be a reason to make sure I write more for my own edification, but doesn’t rule out writing about ideas that will be useful for others.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>YO!!!</strong> I’m tripping up on the same landmine again and again.</p>
<p>I am again not able to see the similarity between “ideas that I <em>know</em> and will be of help to others” and “bullcrap”.</p>
<p>To my dear readers, forgive me for the constant repetition of ideas that I <a href="./Portrait-of-the-Writer-as-an-Ignorant-Fool.html">should have</a> <a href="./The-Double-Edged-Sword-of-Essays.html">understood by now</a>.</p>
<p>I’m dividing ideas into two buckets - ideas that I “understand” and ideas that I don’t.</p>
<h2 id="whaddaya-mean-ideas-you-understand">Whaddaya mean “ideas you understand”?</h2>
<p><a href="./Who-should-you-respect.html">No Action, No Right to Talk</a>.</p>
<p>Unless I have already got insane awesome results in that area, I have no right to say that I “understand” an idea.</p>
<p>Here’s the more important question: If I don’t really understand the idea, what the hell was I writing when I thought I “understood” the idea and was “explaining” it for others?</p>
<p>Rhetorical.</p>
<p>What do I need here? I need some sort of mechanism to protect me from writing in a useless manner about stuff I think I “understand”. I need to write in such a way that I generate ideas that will make me get awesome results. Then, I can come and tell everybody that I understand the ideas.</p>
<h2 id="safety-mechanisms">Safety Mechanisms</h2>
<p>First step would be to identify what kind of essay I’m writing. Is it about an idea that I think I already “understand”? That should send off a huge warning bell.</p>
<p>I should basically be struggling to get ahead in my essay. I should be searching around for ideas, blasting through the walls in my thinking to escape from the fortress of the dread Russian villain Dr. Itsklear Inmahedd.</p>
<p>Would it help if I noted down the insights I generated while writing the essay? In fact, can we go one better? How do we differentiate between what I discovered while writing the essay and what I already had in mind?</p>
<p>Should we do a neat little before-after test, just like in those cosmetic ads? Before I write the essay, I have these ideas that I think are awesome, but are actually tanned and ugly. Then, I <del>apply this awesome fairness cream</del> write the essay, and whoo! I end up with Fair and Lovely ideas!</p>
<p>Ideas before the essay. Ideas after the essay. The difference was generated during the essay.</p>
<p>Another simple test is whether I had <strong>fun</strong> writing the essay.</p>
<p>Another one is - Did the ideas <em>surprise</em> me? I’m convinced that there is a deep connection between surprise and quality writing. (I’m just putting on a scene, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html">Thalaivar PG covered that stuff</a> like ages ago. Won’t prevent me from ripping him off, just like I’m ripping off two-three other awesome thinkers.)</p>
<p>Cool. We’ve got a start here. Let’s not generate too many airy-fairy ideas and then use that as an excuse for not taking any action at all. I’ll apply these actions and tests as I’m writing essays for the next one week and we can take it from there!</p>
<h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>
<p>How am I Keeping it Real in this essay? Am I doing what I said I would do in the previous essays? From my <a href="./How-to-write-well-Part-1.html#checklist-for-writing-safely">Checklist for Writing Safely</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resist writing complete one-stop-shop essays that “explain” an idea fully. Keep it open-ended. Cos it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Next time, keep track of ideas generated, before and after. Fun. Surprise. Is this about an idea you “understand”?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>PS</strong>: Every time I write the word “essay”, there’s some critic in my mind saying, “Who the f*ck do you think you are? You think what you’re writing are ‘<strong><em>essays</em></strong>’? They’re just crap.”</p>
<p>Why am I mentioning that in this <em>essay</em>? Could it help me overcome my fear of being judged on my <em>essays</em>? Could it send a message to my inner critic (through this <em>essay</em>) that I ain’t backing off and that it should go f*ck its own ass, while I’m writing this <em>essay</em>? Could it also be helpful to other people who doubt themselves similarly when writing <em>essays</em>?</p>
<p>Why have I stopped asking my reader a lot of questions? Why was I doing that in the first place? Shouldn’t I be doing more of it (in my <em>essays</em>)?</p>

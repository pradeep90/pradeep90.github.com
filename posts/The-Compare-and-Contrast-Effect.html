<p><strong>Note to regular readers</strong>: I didn’t publish the essays I wrote over the last three days because of phase v0.5 (Delay + Rewriting) of The Great 300-Word Experiment. Will write about that in a couple of days. Now that it has begun, there shouldn’t be any more gaps.</p>
<p>Now, back to your regularly scheduled crap essay of the day.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What happens when you go to the movie equivalent of an all-you-can-eat buffet?</p>
<h1 id="a-torrent-of-awesomeness">A torrent of awesomeness</h1>
<p>We saw how <a href="./The-Perks-of-Piracy.html">Piracy</a> is the awesomest thing in the world. We also kicked the crap out of stupid reasons people give against Piracy.</p>
<p>But then, we saw how people come to like something more when they have worked harder for it or paid more for it.</p>
<p>Next, we saw how merely having lots of books can make it less likely that you will ever read any of them, the way a To-Do List makes it less likely that you will get it done.</p>
<p>What else happens when you have such easy access to a buttload of movies and books?</p>
<h1 id="compare-and-contrast">Compare and Contrast</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: How do you make a rod shorter without touching it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer is simple. You place a longer rod next to it.</p>
<p>Yes, it makes it only <em>seem</em> shorter, it doesn’t actually make it shorter. So what? The impact is the same, your mind thinks it is shorter. That is all that matters in the end.</p>
<p><strong>Case A</strong>:</p>
<p>You’ve got an awesome movie that you want to watch. Say it’s Pulp Fiction. You’ve somehow never watched it before. You’ve heard lots of rave reviews about it. You finally get your hands on the movie. You’ve been waiting for this for a few days now. There is no other movie you have with you. You look forward to this all day.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, you curl up on your sofa or bed and have an awesome time watching this great movie. The dialogues are awesome, the direction is brilliant, the screenplay is out of this world, the music is awesome in a weird way, and the camera-work is unbelievable.</p>
<p>You rave about it. You think about it the next day. You write a review on it on your blog.</p>
<p><strong>Case B</strong>:</p>
<p>You come back home from work or college. You lay back on the couch and browse your 500GB external hard drive. You don’t know which movie you want to watch.</p>
<p>You have all of Quentin Tarantino’s movies, all of Nolan’s movies, all of DiCaprio’s movies, all of Rajnikanth’s movies, the Matrix series, all of Shankar’s movies, all of [insert your favourite Khan]’s movies. You have every single movie in the IMDB Top 100 list, Top 100 Hindi Movies list, Top 100 Action Movies list, Top 100 Fantasy movies list. (Ok, maybe you have a couple of external hard drives for all these movies).</p>
<p>Which one do you watch? The Matrix? The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly? The Dark Knight? American Beauty? Saving Private Ryan? Pulp Fiction? Shawshank Redemption? Forrest Gump? The Usual Suspects?</p>
<p>You pick one at random. It’s Pulp Fiction. You watch it. It’s pretty good. You go to bed.</p>
<hr />
<p>Which one do you want?</p>
<p>What happened there in Case B?</p>
<h1 id="the-real-movie-experience">The Real Movie Experience</h1>
<p>What happened was the movie equivalent of the shorter-rod problem. Simply by keeping all these awesome movies beside each other, you effectively robbed yourself of the great effect they could have on you if you had watched them individually without comparison.</p>
<p>This isn’t some airy-fairy thing. This is a real loss. This has a real impact on your enjoyment. You will have measurably lower excitement levels when you watch even the most epic of movies.</p>
<p>Be honest to yourself - how many of the great classic movies you watched actually turned out to be only ok movies? Could some part of that be due to the Compare and Contrast effect?</p>
<p>How would you really want to experience these great movies?</p>
<p>Remember, these movies were each released <em>individually</em>, with months, possibly years between each of them. People would wait for these movies with great anticipation and stuff.</p>
<p>And here you are experiencing all of them one after the other with all the reverence of an illiterate man using a holy book as a leg-stand for a shaky table. It’s like watching something in 144p when you could have enjoyed it at 1080p Dolby Digital Surround Sound IMAX 4D.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-a-great-movie">What is a Great Movie?</h1>
<p>First, a word from our dumb-asses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dude! I’m a seeker of the Truth. If the movies are really good, then they will be good no matter how I see them. If they aren’t awesome when I watch them alongside other movies, then they aren’t really “<strong>Great Movies</strong>”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Talk about completely missing the point. Why do you watch movies?</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but I watch them for the entertainment value. I want to feel the excitement. I want to be transported to a world far away from my everyday trials and tribulations and whatnot. I want to experience all the emotions - joy, fear, anger, frustration, triumph, love, etc. I want the sense of AWE when I see some Awe-some movie laid out on some epic awe-some scale.</p>
<p>What is a “<strong>Great Movie</strong>”? One that has got 5 stars from the reviewers?</p>
<p>Nah. <del>No Impact, No Right to Talk</del>. A movie can be as highly rated as it wants, but if it doesn’t give me the value I want from it, then it isn’t worth my time. A movie is great if it gives me the great emotions I want from it.</p>
<p>But, the value you get from a movie depends <em>a lot</em> on the circumstances in which you watch it. Remember, you will value more that which you work hard for.</p>
<p>Similarly, you will value more that which you don’t compare with other stuff.</p>
<p>So, if <em>not</em> comparing it with other things gives me more excitement and joy and emotions and stuff, that is what I should do.</p>
<hr />
<p>So what is up with all this? Is having all this stuff good or bad? All this sounds ok in theory? But what is the impact? What action should I take?</p>
<p>(<em>to be continued</em>)</p>

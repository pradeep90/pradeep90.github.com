<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: v0.2? What’s that?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-story-so-far">The story so far</h2>
<p>I first announced <a href="./The-Great-300-Word-Experiment.html">The Great 300-Word Experiment</a> a couple of weeks ago. Of course, the Experiment was launched before that post. That’s how you got the 12 posts before it.</p>
<p>It started out as a pact with the one and only Mr. Special Agent. Neither of us had written anything online in a long while. Time to fix that.</p>
<p>Why this whole thing? Why write so frequently? What’s the point? Dude! Go read the <a href="./The-Great-300-Word-Experiment.html">original post</a>.</p>
<p>So, it was all hunky-dory from thereon in, right? Smooth sailing and whatnot, right? Unbeknown to my dear readers, I had been silent about some aspects of the Experiment. Like what?</p>
<p>Like the fact that it wasn’t ever meant to be the one-stop cure-all for writing problems. It wasn’t even meant to be used for more than a week.</p>
<p>Did I plan to drop it after a week? Why am I still writing?</p>
<h2 id="second-chance">Second chance</h2>
<p>The chances of a complete newbie hitting upon the perfect solution to all his writing problems on his first attempt are very low. I knew that. Like any good piece of software, we’re gonna get better with time.</p>
<p>Cool. That sounds pretty reasonable. Nobody can argue with “getting better with time”. Nah. It’s more extreme than that. Not only do you keep yourself open to improvements in the future. You do the least amount of work necessary to get the first version rolling.</p>
<p>More on this stuff later (as I keep figuring out more of it).</p>
<h2 id="vision-and-revision">Vision and Revision</h2>
<p>(And that’s “vee-oh-point-two”, by the way)</p>
<p>We needed to learn our lessons from the first week.</p>
<p>What was the single biggest source of problems in the first one week of the Experiment? What sucked about it? And what was awesome about it?</p>
<p>Initially, I thought the way ahead was to have a bunch of essays around in various stages of completion and then keep improving each of them incrementally. The idea was that you would add the minimum amount necessary to a page (say, around 300 words), call it an “essay”, and publish it online. It needn’t be complete. It needn’t make sense. Nothing. <a href="./Quantity-over-Quality.html">No hard requirements at all</a>.</p>
<p>That way, I reasoned, you would end up with a small core of sparkling gems after a couple of months or so of incremental accumulation and polishing. The idea was that you would keep adding a section or two of an essay everyday and build up a solid collection of essays after a few months. That is why some of my essays from the first week are rather incomplete and unclear. They were just initial drafts waiting for more polishing.</p>
<p>So what happened? This sounds pretty cool, right? Wouldn’t I end up with an awesome bunch of essays like <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">Paul Graham</a> this way?</p>
<h2 id="reality-bites">Reality bites</h2>
<p>It failed completely!</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Cos new things are shinier and more attractive. There was just <strong>no way</strong> I was gonna go back and edit a post and merely <em>improve</em> it when I could be writing a completely new essay! Ditto for Mr. Special Agent. New essay, new topic, new feedback, one more essay in my <a href="../archive.html">Archives</a> section - oh! It’s a whole new world out there!</p>
<h2 id="major-bug-fix-for-v0.2">Major bug fix for v0.2</h2>
<p>F*ck trying to update the same old shit. Ain’t gonna work (at least not yet). Maybe we’ll give it another shot later. There are some essays it would be suitable for. But that’s a long way out there.</p>
<p>So, the major change was that we would now focus on writing sequences of posts on the same topic instead of stand-alone complete essays.</p>
<p>You can think of the advantages of the new approach. Something goes wrong? You’re not feeling in a good mood today? Wrote a bunch of crap? No matter. Simply press the Restart button and make a fresh strike tomorrow. Plus, you get to see a long list of essays behind you. Sure feels good. You can always leave things incomplete and tell the reader you’re gonna take it up in an upcoming post. More on this in an upcoming post.</p>
<p>Everything else from the Original Experiment still holds, not that there were too many conditions.</p>

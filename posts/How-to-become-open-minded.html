<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: When are we not open-minded to an idea?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="how-to-kill-an-idea">How to Kill an Idea</h1>
<p>Nobody sane is going to reject an idea after they can clearly see that it does yield awesome results. So how do people manage to go about life without accepting the great ideas they bump into every day?</p>
<p>Let’s answer a different question. What is the best way to get a group of people to instantly have very low respect for an idea? What is the best way to make sure that they will not take that idea seriously at all in the future?</p>
<p>Should you make them watch some one-sided documentaries about that idea? Perhaps show them an impressive powerpoint presentation with made-up statistics? Hmmm… not bad ideas. But these aren’t good enough. You need to bring out the big guns.</p>
<p>You do it the same way you get rid of a Boggart - you make it look <strong>ridiculous</strong>.</p>
<p>You laugh at it. You make jokes about its mama. (“Hey, yo mama is so fat, she…”) Doesn’t have to be the slightest bit logical. Just attack it from whatever angles you can find. Ain’t nobody gonna be caught dead accepting an idea when their entire group has laughed at it for ten minutes.</p>
<p>Hey! This is just one of the 71 Ways to Kill an Idea. Lots more on this coming soon.</p>
<h1 id="first-line-of-defense">First line of defense</h1>
<p>Here’s a surefire way to make sure an Idea doesn’t make its way into your head.</p>
<p>Picture this scenario - you’re arguing with your friend about something. You <em>know</em> you’re right. That guy just won’t listen to you. Then, he makes one more statement. You’re about to demolish it just like the last 15 statements when you realize… “F*ck, he’s actually right.” You may not say it out loud in your mind, but somewhere inside, a tiny lightbulb just lit up.</p>
<p>What do you do? You do what every self-respecting man does. You try to make it sound like you had always been aware of that idea and keep arguing using your original points. Just smooth over the part where he was right.</p>
<p>Start every sentence with “But…”</p>
<p>“But, if I <a href="./The-Great-300-Word-Experiment.html">wrote an essay everyday</a>, I won’t have any time at all for myself.”</p>
<p>“But, if I kept <a href="./Why-take-the-high-road.html">pressing Grow</a> and never <a href="./Revenge-or-Grow.html">took Revenge</a>, people would lose respect for me and would insult me all the time.”</p>
<p>“But, if I don’t <a href="./Low-Information-Diet.html">read the newspaper everyday</a>, how will I be up-to-date with the current affairs?”</p>
<p>Or if you are a true master of the art, you just look him straight in the face and say “You’re wrong” and then change the topic. Funny how often that works.</p>
<p>Do all of the above and no unwanted idea will ever be able to get past the security system of your mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But, you can’t change the truth. We will <em>know</em> that it is really the truth. And so we won’t be able to live with ourselves. We will feel the urge to change. We can’t keep truthful Ideas out of our head.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ha! What is the truth? What do you mean when you say “X is true”?</p>
<p>When you say “X is true”, what you really mean is “I think X is true”. That is, your <em>mind</em> thinks X is true.</p>
<p>Which means, for X not to be true, all that has to happen is your mind must think X is not true. How difficult do you think <em>that</em> is?</p>
<h1 id="the-magic-words">The Magic Words</h1>
<p>How do we make sure a true Idea actually has a chance of getting into our head? We use the magic words. Once that tiny lightbulb in your head has lit up, pull no stops.</p>
<p>Here they are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>You’re right.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s it. You say “You’re right” and then you Shut the F*ck Up.</p>
<p>You don’t say “You’re right… But, …”. That sentence is just your old “But…” statement with some extra useless words in front.</p>
<p>No Impact, No Right to Talk. If you want ideas to have their full Impact on your mind, if you want be a truly open-minded person, you need to say, “You’re right” and then stop. Let it sink in.</p>
<p>I learnt this from my buddy Sujeet. I noticed that <em>every single</em> time I came up with some good argument against something he was saying, he didn’t try to push forward and make excuses like “But… what if…”. He said “You’re right” and then actually let the new idea sink in.</p>
<p><strong>That</strong> is what I’m talking about!</p>
<h1 id="taking-it-to-the-next-level">Taking it to the Next Level</h1>
<p>Ok. We saw how you should accept New and True Ideas <strong>immediately</strong>. No hesitation, no ifs, no buts. We say “you’re right” and then Shut the F*ck Up.</p>
<p>Do we stop there?</p>
<p>When can we call ourselves Open-minded?</p>
<p>Conversely, who has no right to call themselves “Open-minded”?</p>
<p>Say someone makes a good point against you. You do the right thing. You say “you’re right”. Are you done? Are you Open-minded now? One month later, your life is no different from that of a person who didn’t accept that new idea. Are you “open-minded”? Does it make a difference?</p>
<p>It’s obvious. No Impact, No Right to call ourselves “open-minded”. We need to go and take butt-loads of action on the new idea. Take Action and see the Impact. Then, you can go back to your village and tell everyone that you’re officially an Open-minded person.</p>

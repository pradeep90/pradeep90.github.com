<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What determines how much motivation you have for doing a task?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="straight-up">Straight up</h1>
<p>Here it is, developed by scientists after years of scientific research and backed up by a lot of experimental data:</p>
<p><img src="http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/procrastination-equation.png" class alt="Motivation Equation image" /></p>
<p>In English, Motivation basically <em>increases</em> as you increase Value and Expectancy, and <em>decreases</em> as you increase Delay and Impulsiveness.</p>
<p>“Value” is how much you think the reward of a task will be. In my mind, it’s the perceived value of the task according to you, not the actual value.</p>
<p>“Expectancy” is how much you expect to succeed. Again, this is not about the actual odds, but perceived odds.</p>
<p>“Delay” is the delay from Now till the point where you get the reward(s). There are a few subtleties here, but I’ll go into those later.</p>
<p>“Impulsiveness” is your susceptibility to delay - how likely you are to be distracted by other things. I interpret this as a measure of the temptations or impulses that are likely to lead you astray. The more there are, the less motivation you will have for the current task.</p>
<p>There you have it, the sum total of what scientists agree on the current research in motivation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though we are always learning more, the procrastination equation accounts for every major finding on procrastination, and draws upon our best current theories of motivation.</p>

<h1 id="the-fundamental-meta-question-of-rationality">The Fundamental Meta-Question of Rationality</h1>
<p>Remember one of the Big Problems - <a href="./Akrasia.html">Akrasia</a>? If you’d been <a href="./Barriers-to-Entry.html">reading along</a>, you’d have seen that Motivation was basically the Hidden Gang Leader behind Akrasia (IMHO).</p>
<p>Knowing the Essence of Motivation (via the Motivation Equation above) goes a <em>long</em> way towards helping us conquer the problem of Akrasia. We now have crucial information about the enemy.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s only an Idea. There’s many a slip between the cup and the lip, and the only thing we will <a href="./Who-should-you-respect.html">respect</a> is cold, hard <strong>Impact</strong>.</p>
<p>So, we will ask the Fundamental Meta-Question of Rationality: If your Rationality technique is so good, why haven’t you got Insane Impact yet?</p>
<p>To ask that question is to answer it. Else, why aren’t you a Super Saiyan yet? Why isn’t your power level <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5196mjp9fcU">over 9000</a>? No excuses. No talking about <a href="./Who-should-you-respect.html#potential-argument">potential for change in the future</a> (in general).</p>
<p>That is where the battles lie in the future. I believe the fundamental challenge here is to <em>leverage</em> the above Essence of Motivation and get the Maximum Impact out of it. The current level of achievement is not enough, nowhere near enough. We need more, much much more!</p>
<h1 id="motivation-opposite-of-procrastination">Motivation != Opposite of Procrastination</h1>
<p>Currently, researchers are calling this equation the Procrastination Equation. They use it to analyze and explain why people procrastinate. They talk about “techniques” that will help people not procrastinate so much (see FMQoR above, though).</p>
<p>I’m like, yo! WTF! This is way way beyond Procrastination. If Motivation is what makes people do things, then this Equation is the key to explaining <em>every f*cking kind</em> of human behaviour.</p>
<p>Isn’t Procrastination merely the inverse of Motivation? If you don’t have Motivation to do something, aren’t you procrastinating on it?</p>
<p>Well, technically, yes.</p>
<p>But we are humans reading this. To <em>us</em>, there is a subtle but huge difference between the concepts of Motivation and Procrastination.</p>
<p>Procrastination, as we see it, means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Oh, I have actions A, B, and C that will produce value for me. I did A today. But I <em>procrastinated</em> on B and C. I’ll probably do them tomorrow. Or next week.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s well and good. But we’re missing out on the bigger picture.</p>
<p>The Bigger Picture (TM):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You have actions A, B, C, …, Z, and beyond that will produce value for you. You are effectively <em>blind</em> to all those other actions beyond C because you have super-low <strong>Motivation</strong> for them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In reality, those actions past C are not even part of your picture. You don’t even <em>realize</em> that you’re missing out on them.</p>
<p>When you think you <em>procrastinate</em>, you are deeply conscious that you <em>failed</em> to do something that you intended to do. Here, you don’t even realize that you are screwing things up.</p>
<hr />
<p>Example: You plan to buy a bunch of books for your schoolwork and also pay a few bills. You buy the books but you <em>procrastinate</em> on paying the bills. Cool. But what you don’t even see is all the other stuff you could have done. You could have exercised for a while, you could have brushed up on old topics, you could have written a few essays (wink wink nudge nudge) - but you didn’t. Why not? Cos you had very low Motivation for those things.</p>
<p>A casual smoker may only procrastinate on a few tasks in the office but he is missing out on one of the most impactful actions - namely quitting smoking - that could add a decade or so to his life in the final calculation and save him tons of money on top. Why not? Cos he has very low Motivation for that thing.</p>
<p>Random motherf*ckers may be procrastinating on studying for their semester exams (and be acutely aware of it), but they don’t even think of exercising regularly, losing weight, spending less time screwing up their body in front of the computer, brushing and flossing at night, or researching job positions that will decide the shape of their career. Why not? Cos they have very low Motivation for those things.</p>
<h1 id="the-game-changers">The Game-Changers</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hey, SPK, you’re being too harsh, man. Those things are very hard to keep track of. You can’t do everything. You can’t think of everything you need to do. You just try to do the best you can.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is important to know about the things you are not doing, things you are not even considering, because these are the <strong>Game-Changers</strong>. The war is won or lost in these battles.</p>
<p>Remember, not every change is an improvement, but every improvement is a change. If you want to get way more Impact than people usually do, you need to make changes. And you’re not gonna make important changes by doing what you already have Motivation for - that’s the stuff everybody already does.</p>
<p>Things which will have consequences only in the far-off future have High Delay and therefore, immensely low Motivation in our mind. Things like staving off lung cancer by quitting smoking or keeping fit to ward off heart problems and whatnot or saving enough money for our retirement are all things that we couldn’t give less of a f*ck about. They happen way way in the future - hence, very low Motivation.</p>
<p>To be blunt, all the majorly important things - all the <a href="./The-Big-Problems.html">Big Problems</a> - are the ones for which we have low Motivation. Starting from normal catastrophic risks like Global warming and overpopulation and poverty and stuff and going on to <a href="./All-the-difference-in-the-world.html#what-does-it-really-mean-to-be-not-normal">non-normal</a> catastrophic risks that I will discuss soon - these are not even on our radar. We don’t even <em>realize</em> we should be doing something about these things, forget about actually taking Impactful action.</p>
<p>Know this now - there are actions that could create Epic Impacts on your life right away if only you knew you needed to do them. There are always things you haven’t thought of. Worrying only about the stuff still undone on your To-Do List and figuring out “techniques” for beating procrastination is just mental masturbation. What you <em>really</em> need to be worried about is the stuff you could have done easily if only you had raised your gaze and seen past all the crap clutter that blocks your vision right now. Talking in terms of Procrastination means that you have lost the game already.</p>
<p>Whatever it is that will produce Massive Value in your life, it sure as f*ck ain’t on your To-Do List right now. It isn’t even in your mind anywhere. It’s out there in plain sight, hidden from you by your own obtuseness. The odds are heavily on that the things you really need to do are the ones you’re not even thinking of right now.</p>
<p>To talk simply about f*cking <em>Procrastination</em> is to ignorantly sweep all these massive problems under the rug. The Procrastination stuff is for kids. Let’s focus on the much bigger problems now. Let’s figure out how to get more <em>Motivation</em> for the things that <em>really</em> matter. Those are the things that will decide our fate.</p>

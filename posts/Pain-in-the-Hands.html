<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is gonna be a short post, for obvious reasons.</p>
<h1 id="history">History</h1>
<p>I’ve been having a lot of pain in my hands over the last year.</p>
<p>Actually, I’ve been having pain in my hands while typing for a long time now. Yes, I’m dumb and I should have sorted this shit out back when it started. Those are Sunk Costs now. Let me at least fix the problem now.</p>
<p>How long?</p>
<p>I first felt pain in my wrists seven years ago, when I was in the eleventh standard. That is why I started using a different, more ergonomic keyboard layout - the <a href="http://www.dvzine.org/">Dvorak layout</a>.</p>
<p>I didn’t have too much pain after that, but I was always wary of the pain returning. I went to college for a degree in Computer Science. Lots of programming. Such typing. Much pain.</p>
<p>At each point, I suspected different things. I thought it was because I was typing a lot. But then, so were a lot of the other people. Why weren’t they feeling pain?</p>
<p>I then felt I was resting my wrists on the keyboard while typing. So, I tried to stop doing that. Dunno if I fully succeeded, because that shit happens unconsciously.</p>
<p>At some point after my second year in college, I wasn’t able to use the mouse without feeling pain. I did everything using keyboard shortcuts because using the mouse increased my discomfort. Using my laptop’s mousepad was the worst of all - it hurt badly.</p>
<p>Midway through my final year, the pain kinda became a constant. It was at its peak when I did intense programming, say before a project deadline. But it was there all the time. I had trouble writing the exams. Writing with a pen or pencil hurt way worse than typing. I guess gripping the pen and making it move finely stressed my hands a lot.</p>
<h1 id="geography">Geography</h1>
<p>It hurts in the middle of my palms. Then, the thumb muscle (the part below the thumb). Then, the base of each finger - it hurts there the way it hurts after you write a really long exam paper.</p>
<p>Recently, it is hurting at the base of my wrists, the place where my hand and wrists are joined. And then, a third of the way down the hand… it hurts like there’s a nerve in there which is throbbing. I feel like massaging that place to relieve the pain.</p>
<p>Plus, it hurts at the tips of my fingers.</p>
<h1 id="advice">Advice</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Patient: Doctor, it hurts when I move my hand this way.</p>
<p>Doctor: Well, then, don’t do that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think I can stop typing anytime soon.</p>
<p>I need to type a lot at work. I’m working as a programmer right now. So, I’m at my desk for around 8 hours everyday.</p>
<p>Plus, all the important stuff I want to do in life - coming up with ideas, writing essays, writing programs, whatever… <del>everything depends on me typing like hell</del> everything <em>seems</em> to depend on me typing like hell.</p>
<h1 id="its-personal.-not.">It’s personal. Not.</h1>
<p>I kept thinking that I have pain in my hands because I’m doing something totally wrong, like there is something uniquely broken about me. It felt like I deserved the pain or something. Like, the more of a dumbass you are, the more pain you will keep getting.</p>
<p>I’m not so sure of that anymore.</p>
<p>It was only towards the final year of college that I began to notice similar symptoms among my classmates. There was a guy who used to flex his hands every so often while playing Quake using the mouse. I asked him why and he said he was feeling some discomfort. He wasn’t too worried about it.</p>
<p>Some other guys were looking out for solutions to the pain in their hands.</p>
<p>I started getting the feeling that I am not alone.</p>
<h1 id="cause">Cause</h1>
<p>What do I think are the causes of this pain?</p>
<p>I don’t know for sure.</p>
<p>What increases the pain?</p>
<p>What decreases the pain?</p>
<p>Is there a cure?</p>
<p>Lots more on this coming soon.</p>
<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
<p>I don’t know the best way forward.</p>
<p>But if there is a way for me to get rid of this pain and stop it from ruining my life, I’m gonna find it. And take action on it.</p>
<p>This is the most important problem I’m facing right now. It has been elevated to top priority. Pain has a way of making that happen.</p>

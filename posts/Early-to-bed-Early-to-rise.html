<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: How to wake up early in the morning consistently?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="late-risers-anonymous">Late-Risers Anonymous</h2>
<p>Hi everyone. I am SPK and I am a late-riser.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hi SPK!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the last one month, I haven’t woken up earlier than 11am even on a single day. On weekends, I’m usually in bed till around 1pm. I only go to sleep after 2am every night.</p>
<h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2>
<p>Really. So what? So what if I wake up late? I could be kicking ass in those extra hours I’m spending at night, right?</p>
<p>The data suggests otherwise. I’m usually productive only till around midnight or max 1am. After that, I feel it’s just a crapshoot.</p>
<h2 id="the-magic-of-sunshine">The Magic of Sunshine</h2>
<p>Every single time in my life I have woken up early (aka “woken up before 9am”), I have felt blessed. It feels so great to experience the morning life - the tranquility, the fresh air, the cool breeze, all the usual poetic kinda crap. But there’s no denying it - it feels to me like there’s something <strong>magical</strong> about the morning time.</p>
<p>Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!!!</p>
<p>Stop it right there. Let’s take a step back and look at it more deeply. How do we judge the awesomeness of something?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Number of likes on Facebook</p></li>
<li><p>Number of views on Youtube</p></li>
<li><p>How much your friends rave about it</p></li>
<li><p>How much your parents and grandparents praise it</p></li>
<li><p>The actual Impact it has</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What is the realistic impact I expect to get if I wake up everyday at some ungodly hour (say, 7am)?</p>
<p>I can wake up and do some kind of quiet meaningful thinking and whatnot [citation needed][vague][hard to measure impact][wishful thinking].</p>
<p>Next.</p>
<p>No. Seriously, man. I can do lots of awesome stuff if I wake up early in the morning. Really.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to evaluate this claim. The best action that comes to mind is to actually try it out for a couple of weeks and see the difference in front of my eyes. Easier said.</p>
<h2 id="oops-i-did-it-again">Oops I did it again</h2>
<p>I can live a healthier life if I wake up earlier? How?</p>
<p>Dude! I’m seriously not able to give any clear explanations. It all comes down to this - I believe that if I wake up early in the morning, I will have X times more energy to go and get all the <em>right</em> things done.</p>
<p>Like what? For example, by the time I get to 2:30am at night, I feel like I’m already screwed.</p>
<p>“I’ve screwed up today too. I’m such an idiot. How could I make the same mistake again and again and again?”</p>
<p>And then I feel so bad I don’t do anything right. I don’t brush my teeth. I don’t wash my face or do anything to feel relaxed as I go out bed. I just grumble and mutter and jump straight into bed feeling frustrated and feeling like I’m draining precious units of Life out of the limited reserve I have.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-kill-yourself">How to kill yourself</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Adho andha tea-kadai vasal-lae okkanthu uffu-uffu-nu oodharadhu paaru… Adhu cigarette illa da… un appan raththam.”</p>
<p>“When you sit at the tea stall and blow smoke into the air… that isn’t a cigarette you’re smoking… that’s your father’s blood.”</p>
<p>– The father from <strong><em>7G Rainbow Colony</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is exactly how I feel every time I stay up late. I cannot choose to ignore the truth (at least not when it is this obvious). I can just feel my life-blood f*cking evaporating when I do retarded shit like this. It’s hurting me every single time I do it and it’s paving the way for future such mistakes.</p>
<p>When you’re young, you feel immortal. Like you can never really die. You know, there’s the obvious stuff - like riding a motorbike too fast through traffic or doing crazy stunts with it, like not giving a damn about any risks when jumping off buildings, or like throwing everything else clean out of your mind when someone has <em>dared</em> you to do something.</p>
<p>And then there’s stuff like staying up late at night everyday, not eating breakfast, sitting at the computer for too long. Hey! When has not eating breakfast ever killed anyone, right? What’s this guy’s problem? He’s such a killjoy.</p>
<p>More on this coming up.</p>
<h2 id="ps">PS</h2>
<p>Sadly, it’s 2:39am right now. Not cool. I’ll crack this problem, though. Why else did I write this essay?</p>
<p>Insights while writing this essay?</p>
<p>The W** effect. The frustration I feel when I see myself doing retarded shit. Good and Bad. Self-compassion. Facing the darkness. Much deleted from here cos it’s late - will come in the follow-up essay.</p>

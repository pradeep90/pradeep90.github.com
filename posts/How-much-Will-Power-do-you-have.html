<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: Why does <a href="./Akrasia.html">Akrasia</a> exist?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="running-on-empty">Running on empty</h1>
<p>We saw <a href="./Akrasia.html">yesterday</a>, that not doing stuff we should be doing isn’t a problem you alone face. It’s a problem everyone faces. The name of the game is Akrasia. So, we know the name of our enemy now. If we can figure out his weaknesses, if we can find out the source of his power (and the cause of our troubles) - hey, we would really be in business.</p>
<p>What really stops us from getting things done?</p>
<p>Think about the last time you failed to do something you knew you should do. For example, I had a long day at work today. Did a lot of thinking and stuff. And then, for dinner tonight, I… um… had one or two items I… uh… shouldn’t have had. Or maybe seven. I lost track. And then, I sat on the couch and watched TV for an hour more. Then, procrastinated for a bit more surfing the web before I decided to finally start writing this essay (past midnight).</p>
<p>Akrasia. It’s a bitch.</p>
<p>What was happening?</p>
<h1 id="testing-times">Testing times</h1>
<p>Why was it such a big problem for me to resist eating crap tonight? Why was it such a drag for me to come and start writing this essay? I’m usually at my computer immediately after dinner to resume <a href="./The-Great-300-Word-Experiment.html">The Great 300-Word Experiment</a>. What went wrong?</p>
<p>Is there something wrong with me? Or is the “magic” of The Great 300-Word Experiment finally wearing off? Am I broken somehow? Will I never be able to get anything awesome done?</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Hold it there.</p>
<p>How do you find out if something is true? You test it.</p>
<p>So, stop with the whining and listen to this story.</p>
<h1 id="the-radish-and-the-cookie">The radish and the cookie</h1>
<p>Once upon a time, a guy named Roy Baumeister (and some others) got a bunch of people together. He wanted to test something. These people were told that they were going to be part of a psychological study on taste and memory. They were asked not to eat anything for three hours before the study. They were divided into two groups.</p>
<p>When one group came into the research lab, they found a bunch of freshly baked cookies on a table. And a bowl of radishes. This group was told that they were going to be tested on the radishes. Awesome. They were asked to <em>not</em> eat any of the cookies and just eat the part of the radish given to them.</p>
<p>The other group was told to eat the cookies as part of their taste test. Yay!</p>
<p>Next, people from both the groups were asked to go to another room for the next part of the study. Here, they were asked to work on a problem that was secretly a stress test. It was basically impossible to solve. The test really was about <em>how long</em> you would go on before you gave up.</p>
<p>And, as you would have guessed by now, the study wasn’t about taste and memory and stuff. It was about a topic very important to you and me - <del>Sex</del> Will Power.</p>
<h1 id="suspense">Suspense</h1>
<p>What do you think happened? Which group do you think tried longer on the problem (which was secretly impossible)?</p>
<p>Did the smell-the-delicious-cookies-but-don’t-eat-them-eat-the-goddamn-radish people try for longer? Or did the take-it-easy-eat-awesome-delicious-cookies people last longer before giving up?</p>
<p>Maybe the radish-eating people are more disciplined or something. Maybe that’s why they ate the radish or something.</p>
<p>Nah. People were divided into groups completely randomly. Which means, there should be no statistically significant difference between the two groups on “discipline” or whatever.</p>
<p>Or maybe radish gives you discipline (like spinach gives you popeye-power). Therefore, they worked longer on the problem. Yeah. That makes sense. Yup. And eating cookies makes you dumb. I mean, when was the last time you saw a brilliant guy eating a cookie. Surely that’s the reason why the cookie people must have failed. Too much cookie in their body.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I forgot to mention something. There was yet another group of people who didn’t see either the radishes or the cookies. They just went straight to the impossible-problem stage. How well would they do? They didn’t have radishes, so they must have sucked. But they didn’t have cookies, so they wouldn’t have sucked too badly. Right?</p>
<p>Note down your predictions right now so that you don’t fudge at the end (unlike those cricket commentators who are right no matter who wins).</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="and-the-award-goes-to">And the award goes to…</h1>
<p>So, what really happened? And, most importantly, what does this have to do with Akrasia and Will Power?</p>
<p>Time spent working on the problem before throwing in the towel:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I ain’t seen no radishes or cookies: ~20 minutes</p></li>
<li><p>I can haz cookies: ~19 minutes</p></li>
<li><p>Y U NO give me cookie: ~8 minutes</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Let that sink in. Check the results with your predictions.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<h1 id="the-way-to-the-truth">The Way to the Truth</h1>
<p>The researchers had this idea or hypothesis at the beginning - Will Power is a finite resource. The more you use it. The less you have at the end.</p>
<p>You know what they had to do to see their hypothesis was really true. They had to test it. How do you go about effectively testing such ideas? How do you find out whether A causes B or not?</p>
<p>It’s simple. You make one set of people do A. You make another set of people <strong>not</strong> do A. If the first group gets a different amount of B compared to the second group - then, hey! It’s a jackpot. The <em>only</em> difference between them is A. Therefore, A caused B.</p>
<p>So, in our pseudo-“taste and memory” test, the hypothesis was that Will Power is finite. So, if you used it on one task, you should have less of it left for another task. One group was asked to exert their Will Power. How? By not eating the cookies and eating the goddamn radishes instead. Another group was asked to enjoy themselves - <em>not</em> exert their Will Power. The last group was just like completely normal. This would check whether cookies themselves had any effect.</p>
<p><strong>Rule #1 of Truth-Seeking</strong>: Make your prediction in advance. And if it turns out to be wrong, suck it up. Don’t make excuses.</p>
<p>So, do radishes give you more “discipline” or anything? Nah. How do we know that? Cos if they did, then the radish-group should have lasted longer. They didn’t. Case closed.</p>
<p>Do cookies sap your “discipline” or anything? Not that we can see. They tried longer than the radish people for sure.</p>
<h1 id="ego-depletion">Ego Depletion</h1>
<p>With the crap theories out of the way, let’s look at the main hypothesis. They predicted that people who exerted their Will Power would have less of it left. What happened? Yup. The radish guys sucked at it.</p>
<p>This and a buttload of other experiments have given a lot of evidence for the hypothesis - Will Power is finite.</p>
<p>The technical term for this is “Ego depletion”. You are using up your “Will Power” as you keep making decisions, especially demanding ones.</p>
<p>Does my state of mind this evening make more sense? Could the long taxing workday have anything to do with my Will Power failures at night?</p>
<p>Lot more on this coming soon.</p>
<p>Oh… and, by the way, welcome to the world of Science.</p>

<p><strong>Entry Question</strong>: What is Confusion?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="gravity-of-the-situation">Gravity of the Situation</h1>
<p>Here’s a story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time, a guy took a big, heavy, iron ball and a small, lighter ball to the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. He took them to the edge and then dropped them at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Which ball hit the ground first?</p>
<p>Was it the heavy ball? Did it zoom to the ground first?</p>
<p>Was it the lighter ball? Was it able to gain more speed?</p>
<p>Think about that for a second.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, we all know the answer. The lighter ball hit the ground first. The guy was Galileo and that’s how he verified Newton’s Theory of Gravity. The “experiment” shocked one and all. Everyone assumed that the heavy ball would reach first.</p>
<p>What happened? That was the beauty of Newton’s Theory of Gravity. Nobody else could come up with such an awesome theory.</p>
<hr />
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Bazinga!</p>
<p>By this point, you should either be angry at me or be confused about the Bazinga.</p>
<p>Why? Cos I lied about the answer. Did you accept the answer I gave? Did you just nod your head and move on?</p>
<p>It wasn’t the lighter ball that hit the ground first. It was the heavy ball. The fact that you didn’t realize this meant that you were confused about the Theory of Gravity. That’s not how gravity works. The force of gravity is proportional to the mass of the object. So, obviously, the heavy object will reach the ground first.</p>
<p>That is what it means to be confused. You just accept whatever answer you think actually happened in reality.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Double Bazinga!</p>
<p>It wasn’t the heavy ball that reached first. It was the lighter ball.</p>
<p>Well. Nope. The truth is that both the balls reached the ground at the same time.</p>
<p>This is one of the most counter-intuitive results I have ever heard of. Not in a hundred years on my own would I have <em>ever</em> imagined that a heavy iron ball and a small rubber ball would reach the ground at the same time.</p>
<p>If a scientist had come to me and given me the “explanation” about how the heavier ball would hit the ground first, I would have accepted it. If, alternatively, a scientist had come to me and given me the “counter-intuitive explanation” of how the lighter ball would have hit the ground first, I would have accepted it. I wouldn’t have said, “Wait a minute… how is that possible?”. I was confused about gravity outside of the physics classroom. If you had accepted either of the earlier “results” or either of the earlier “explanations”, you were confused about gravity just like I was.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="beliefs-must-pay-rent">Beliefs must pay Rent</h1>
<p>What happened back there? Why did you and I accept plausible-sounding wrong explanations? Because we had no idea that those outcomes were not allowed (lighter ball first or heavier ball first). In other words, our anticipation about what would happen was not constrained.</p>
<p>We saw that prediction is <a href="./The-Map-and-the-Territory.html#prediction-constrained-anticipation">constrained anticipation</a>. If you expect X to happen with high probability, you cannot expect Y to happen with high probability too. Your expectations are constrained. Beliefs are what allow you to make predictions. They are nothing but <a href="./Hypothetically-Speaking.html">hypotheses</a> in your head.</p>
<p>Beliefs must constrain anticipation for them to be useful. If you believe that humans evolved from other animals over a long time, you cannot simultaneously believe that they were created in one shot a few thousand years ago. In other words, you cannot believe Evolutionary Biology and believe in your religion at the same time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Belief = Anticipation Constraint</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your beliefs about a topic must pay rent. They must constrain your anticipation.</p>
<h1 id="being-wrong-vs-being-confused">Being Wrong vs Being Confused</h1>
<p>When is someone <em>wrong</em> about a topic? When they have wrong <em>beliefs</em> about a topic. i.e., they make the wrong anticipations about events related to that topic.</p>
<p>When you have wrong beliefs, they will pay rent, but it will be wrong. You have a belief that John is a kindly person who would never hurt anyone. This means you believe he won’t do hurtful things to others. Your belief that John is kind constrains your anticipation. However, tomorrow, if he beats up his friend for spilling coffee on his shirt, you will be proven wrong. You predicted that this would never happen, but it happened. You will be surprised.</p>
<p>When you have wrong beliefs, you can be surprised.</p>
<p>Here’s the clincher: When you’re <em>confused</em>, you can never be surprised.</p>
<p>When you’re confused, your beliefs won’t pay rent. They won’t constrain your anticipation. The lighter ball fell first - oh, ok. The heavier ball fell first - oh, ok. You can’t accept both. Your beliefs about gravity should have constrained your anticipation. But they didn’t.</p>
<h1 id="confusion">Confusion</h1>
<p>“But… but…”, you complain. “I know that topic quite well. I know I have beliefs about that topic.”</p>
<p>That is why we say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Confusion = Beliefs that don’t pay rent (but seem like they do)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You think you have “beliefs” about the topic, but in reality they don’t constrain your anticipation at all. They might as well not exist. The worst part is not that they didn’t pay rent, it’s that you thought they did. You didn’t even realize that you made no useful predictions about the world.</p>
<p>In general, what happens is that we have some beliefs about a topic that pay rent and then a whole bunch of others that pay no rent whatsoever. But because we have so many “beliefs” about that topic, we feel we must know it really well. i.e., “I have understood that topic correctly.”</p>
<h1 id="no-new-predictions">No New Predictions</h1>
<p>When you’re confused, your predictions will be based only on stuff you’ve seen. You will not make any fresh predictions. You saw outcome A happen for some event X. So, next time you come across X, you predict that A will happen. You have nothing to say about other events Y and Z.</p>
<p>So, for gravity, some guy sees the two balls hit the ground together.</p>
<p>“Ok. Balls will hit the ground together when dropped from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Got it. <em>Now</em> I understand gravity.”</p>
<p>Oh yeah? Well, what will happen if I drop one ball from the top of one building and my friend throws a ball straight at me from the top of a faraway building. Which ball will reach the ground first? Oh, and by the way, his ball is 10 times heavier than mine. Good luck with that.</p>
<p>You saw the fact that two balls dropped simultaneously will reach the ground together, irrespective of their mass. So, next time someone pulls the same trick, you can make the correct prediction. But if anything changes even slightly, you are at sea.</p>
<p>It is as if you put the following causal diagram in your mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Gravity” -&gt; Make dropped balls reach ground together – (A)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, it seems to you like you understand “gravity”.</p>
<p>But, apply our test for Beliefs. Is that Belief paying Rent? Is it constraining your anticipation?</p>
<p>“Um… well… yes”, you say. “My belief is telling me that the balls will hit together, not one after another. Isn’t that a constrained anticipation?”</p>
<p>The simple test for that is to remove the belief from your mind. Do your other beliefs still constrain your anticipation as before?</p>
<p>Well, yeah. Even if you remove your belief about “gravity”, you <em>did</em> see the demonstration with the heavy and light balls. It was <em>that</em> fact that constrained your anticipation. Your belief about “gravity” had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>Your belief (A) by itself didn’t do anything new for you. It didn’t constrain anticipation in any way that you hadn’t been doing before.</p>
<p>i.e., it didn’t pay rent.</p>
<p>Whether you have that belief about “gravity” or not, your anticipations about reality are exactly the same. Every belief in your mind should produce some rent on its <em>own</em>. It should make some new anticipation constraints that you couldn’t have made without it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Confusion = Beliefs that don’t pay any new rent (but seem like they do).</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="no-surprises-here">No Surprises Here</h1>
<p>When you’re confused, you won’t notice it. Your beliefs don’t constrain anticipation, so anything can happen. When you’re right, you’re surprised by wrong answers. When you’re wrong, you’re surprised by right answers. When you’re confused, you’re surprised by nothing.</p>
<p>Just look at astrology. Something good happened: I told you so. Something bad happened: I told you so.</p>
<p>Yo! You can’t have it both ways.</p>
<p>This is why people believing in astrology are not surprised by whatever happens in their life. There are lots of biases that help keep their belief intact (confirmation bias, etc.), but the fact is, whatever happens, they will just attribute it to some vague clause that was there in the original astrology “forecast”.</p>
<p>The astrological “forecasts” aren’t forecasts at all. They don’t constrain anticipation. They allow for all possibilities. aka they are beliefs that don’t pay rent. Throw them out.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-protect-your-beliefs-against-everything">How to Protect your Beliefs Against Everything</h1>
<p><strong>Corollary of Confusion</strong>: No matter what happens, you will be super-confident that you have correct knowledge about the topic.</p>
<p>You are never proven wrong by anything. This is how all kinds of oddball beliefs like astrology, religion, etc. keep perpetuating themselves.</p>
<p>You say you have beliefs about how the stars are affecting our lives, but the truth is that those beliefs don’t pay any rent at all. Your anticipations will be exactly the same as a guy who doesn’t have those beliefs.</p>
<p>But, sadly, the difference is that you will almost never be shaken from your belief in astrology (or religion or true love or whatever your favourite cause is). You don’t open yourself to surprise. Your belief cannot be falsified in any way.</p>
<p>How to make sure you or your followers never get shaken in some belief?</p>
<p>Just meet the two requirements of confusion:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li><p>Make them believe they have (strong) beliefs about something</p></li>
<li><p>Then make sure that those beliefs pay no rent whatsoever</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For (A), have an entire series of books/speeches/movies giving attractive and comforting stories, anecdotes, theories, whatever about some vague, undefined, undefinable <em>thing</em> and make them feel that they believe in all of this.</p>
<p>For (B), just take care to never make any falsifiable claims. Don’t pay rent - don’t constrain anticipation in any way, shape, or form. That’s all. If you do slip up and make some testable claims by mistake somewhere, just have a blanket belief saying “Our <em>Thing</em>’s ways are mysterious” that prevents anything from destroying your belief.</p>
<h1 id="the-convenient-because">The Convenient “Because”</h1>
<p>Why did the two balls reach the ground together?</p>
<p>We consult our belief (A) and say “Because of Gravity”. “Gravity” makes the balls hit the ground together.</p>
<p>You could as well have said “Because of Magic”. It is equally effective as an explanation. Saying “gravity” tells you nothing more than you would have known otherwise.</p>
<p>We usually want to know the cause of some phenomenon so that we can change its behaviour. If water is flowing too slowly out of a tap, we can open the tap more to speed it up.</p>
<p>Now, you ask me <em>why</em> people procrastinate on things that they want to do, I reply: “Because of Akrasia”.</p>
<p>That’s the cause I seem to be giving here. Well, what can we do about that? What can we do to increase the number of useful things we do?</p>
<p>I don’t know. Saying “Akrasia” does nothing to help me solve that problem. I don’t know the actual cause or how to manipulate it usefully. I am not specifying any tap that I can open to increase the flow. I might as well have said “Magic”.</p>
<p>Why do people procrastinate on things that they want to do? Because of Magic.</p>
<p>“Akrasia” here is a Fake Explanation. It seems like it is the cause for the phenomenon, just like “Gravity”, but in fact, it gives me no more anticipation-constraint than I had earlier. It doesn’t tell me what will happen if I try some technique X or some other technique Y. Hence, it is of no use to me.</p>
<h1 id="standard-answers-to-standard-questions">Standard Answers to Standard Questions</h1>
<p>That’s what most of us did in school. We went about learning Fake Explanations. We could give Standard Answers to Standard Questions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Why does the light-bulb glow? Because of “electricity”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we couldn’t give answers to related questions we hadn’t heard before. When forced to produce an answer, most of the time we just stood there blankly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What will happen if you replace the tungsten filament with nickel? The electricity is still there. Will the light-bulb glow?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I seriously don’t know the answer to the question. I will just stare at you blankly. I have no idea what the f*ck the “tungsten filament” does in a light bulb.</p>
<p>In other words, I had memorized the <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/iq/guessing_the_teachers_password/">Teacher’s Password</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Electricity” + “Tungsten filament” + “glass bulb” -&gt; Let there be light!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why does a bulb give off light? Because of electricity, tungsten filament, and bulb.</p>
<p>What happens if you replace the tungsten filament with nickel? … (blank)</p>
<p>What happens if you remove the glass bulb? … (blank)</p>
<p>What happens if you remove the electricity? Wait! I know this! The bulb will stop glowing! I saw this yesterday.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? Then why does it still glow for a few seconds even after switching it off? There is no electricity, right? … (blank)</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="the-road-ahead">The Road Ahead</h1>
<p>Ok, SPK. You have me convinced. Confusion is the root of all evil. How do we get rid of Confusion?</p>
<p>I thought you’d never ask.</p>
<p>Welcome to the Matrix, Neo.</p>

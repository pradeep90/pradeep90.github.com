<li><p>Major Trap: It is easy to use the fact/argument that Progress may not be certain to get rid of our responsibilities.</p>
<p>I mean, imagine it. On the one hand, if you believe that Progress is possible, you have this crushing load of work. You need to do this, you need to do that. So much needs to be done. On the other hand, if you think Progress is not gonna happen, then you can just chill the fuck out and do whatever you want. Everything is going down anyway. No responsibility, nothing.</p>
<p>It’s easy to see which path will appeal more to your mind.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I can feel the temptation of just giving everything up and doing whatever the fuck I want without giving a damn about all the problems that need to be solved. Who knows, that may even be the path I decide to take in the end.</p>
<p>But, right now, I need to stay focussed and do the best I can. Maybe there’s no use to it, maybe we’re gonna get screwed, no matter what. But that isn’t a useful thought either way.</p>
<p>Worse, there might be some easy solutions at hand that you miss because you gave up a bit too soon. You may not know how close you were to the finish line.</p>
<p>This is a serious moral hazard. It’s tempting to just take the easy way out.</p>
<p>A tentative solution I have is: work as hard as you can to build up your skills during your 20s, no matter what the verdict be on Progress. Give it a real good try, give it everything you’ve got. If it succeeds, hey, that’s the jackpot. If it fails, cool, we’ll fall back to the original plan of just living it up while it lasts.</p>
<p>But, don’t give up without making an <a href>Extraordinary Effort</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>In fact, Eliezer would recommend going even beyond that to <a href>Shut up and Do the Impossible</a>. I don’t know how that would work. Can’t say much about that now.</p>
<p>But, whatever it be, I’m gonna give it every chance to succeed.</p></li>

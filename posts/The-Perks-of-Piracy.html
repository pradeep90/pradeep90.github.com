<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What is the price of a free book?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="getting-your-hands-on-awesome-stuff">Getting your hands on awesome stuff</h1>
<p>You want to watch entertaining movies. You want to listen to awesome songs. You want to read great books. You want to enjoy sitcoms.</p>
<p>That’s great!</p>
<p>Except that you have to pay quite a bit for that privilege. You have to pay for each movie you rent or buy. You have to pay for each song you download. You have to pay huge amounts for really good and rare books. And if you don’t (or can’t) watch the sitcoms on TV, you have to purchase the DVD or whatever at a cost.</p>
<p>That sucks!</p>
<p>If only there were a way to get all the awesome entertainment and education from the above resources without having to pay such a huge cost…</p>
<p>Wait! What am I talking about? We already have a way. Welcome to the world of Piracy.</p>
<h1 id="the-joys-of-piracy">The Joys of Piracy</h1>
<p>Through the wonderful medium of the Internet, you will have access to every single movie you want to watch. It’s free. You can download tons of movies, tons of sitcoms, tons of porn, and tons of books. And most people do.</p>
<p>In fact, things have reached such a point that people’s appetites are constrained not by the money in their wallet or even by their internet download speed, but by the size of the disks holding all the data. You have to decide which movies to delete so that you can have space on your 500GB disk for all your favourite movies and music and stuff.</p>
<p>Awesome! It seems like we’ve reached the pinnacle of entertainment. All your favourite movies and books (plus some extra crap movies that you had space for)… right in your friendly, neighbourhood external hard drive.</p>
<p>What’s not to like?</p>
<h1 id="crap-counter-argument-1-its-illegal">Crap Counter-Argument #1: It’s illegal</h1>
<p>I don’t even want to spend any time on this reason.</p>
<p>No Impact, No Right to Talk.</p>
<p>What is the expected Impact of downloading all this “illegal” stuff?</p>
<p>Yup. You know it. Nothing is gonna happen. You download movies illegally. Your friends do. Your parents probably do (if they’re computer-literate; else, you do it for them). Everyone does it.</p>
<p>Yes, the websites that host pirated content keep getting shut down. And they keep popping back up again in greater numbers, like the heads of some enormous world-wide Hydra.</p>
<p>So, this argument doesn’t hold any water.</p>
<h1 id="counter-argument-2-morality">Counter-Argument #2: Morality</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s <em>unethical</em> to “steal content”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Person A says piracy is morally wrong.</p>
<p>Person B says piracy is not morally wrong. He can’t give any arguments or whatever.</p>
<p>Person C says piracy is not morally wrong. He whips up dozens of arguments against it. He says that copyright laws are “draconian” (it means they are like Draco Malfoy). And he says that all the money goes to wealthy studios and artistes and writers and stuff and that poor upcoming musicians and artistes don’t get anything. Hence, we should fight the big guys by pirating content.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Don’t take your eyes off the ball, though.</p>
<p>When a hit movie is released next month, what do you predict each of them will do?</p>
<p>If a guy says piracy is wrong and still downloads movies, and another guy doesn’t say anything and downloads movies, what is the difference between them? What is the Impact of having all those “morals” and stuff if you aren’t going to be any different from other people?</p>
<p>And here the counter-argument will come:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But, inside, I will feel <strong>bad</strong> when I pirate stuff. That’s the difference!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which I say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yo! If you say you feel bad and stuff and then there is <em>absolutely</em> no difference between your life and that of a person who didn’t feel bad, what is the point of <em>feeling bad</em>?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You might as well have just taken a Crocin or something to not feel bad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it doesn’t change the world in any way at all, then it might as well not exist.</p>
<p>Let’s make this clear. If people are suffering because of malaria somewhere and you <em>feel bad</em> because of it, is there any point to it? Yes, <em>provided</em> you do something about it. You either go and help those people directly. Or you help some other people who are suffering similarly. Do something.</p>
<p>You need to act <em>differently</em> from someone who didn’t feel bad when they heard about that stuff. Else, there is no point in having all those feelings. Then, it is simply what we call Moral Posturing - making a show out of your feelings to make other people think you are very <a href="./The-Need-to-Qualify.html">virtuous</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, are you really gonna change your behaviour in the slightest because you think piracy is morally wrong? Is your behaviour any different from that of your friends who don’t think piracy is morally wrong?</p>
<p>If not, we need to Shut the F*ck Up and stop the Moral Posturing.</p>
<h1 id="no-free-lunch">No Free Lunch</h1>
<p>Cool. Now we’ve kicked the shit out of all the stupid reasons people use to act superior to you. Piracy is illegal (so what?). Piracy is “immoral” (so what?). There’s gonna be no change in your behaviour or theirs, so there is no point in listening to them.</p>
<p>Hmmm… Perhaps we should look at our own side for a bit.</p>
<p>It seems like Piracy is an obvious win. The question is, how big a win really is it?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Case A</strong>:</p>
<p>You’re walking back from college or work or whatever at around 6pm. You pass an auditorium on your way. Some music is playing loudly inside. It’s pretty good.</p>
<p>A man pops out and comes to you. It seems that inside the auditorium a concert by [insert your favourite musician here] is about to begin.</p>
<p>The man says he will get you in for free. He takes you right past all the cheap seats and gets you right in the front row where you can see [your favourite musician] face-to-face.</p>
<p>And it’s all free. You sit there and enjoy the concert for a couple of hours.</p>
<p><strong>Case B</strong>:</p>
<p>You’re standing in line outside the auditorium where the second part of [your favourite musician]’s World Tour is happening. There is a queue going across the block. All the costly tickets were sold out within minutes of the opening. There is a 50:50 chance that all the tickets would be sold out by the time you get to the head of the queue.</p>
<p>Everybody is pumped up about the concert. You can barely stand in line. You’re chatting non-stop with your friends about how much it’s gonna rock. The air is electric right now. It takes you forty-five minutes to reach the front gate but fortunately you guys manage to get tickets. It’s in the back row, but it’s cool. At least you got in. You make your way to your place through the buzzing crowd and scream at the top of your voice with everyone else when the build-up begins. And then, the concert starts. Three hours of Heaven!</p>
<p>Which one do you want?</p>
<p>Yes, I know they are not exactly comparable, but I’m trying to make a point here.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>A basic Law of Economics is - people pay a lot for things they love.</p>
<p>A basic Law of Psychology is - people love a lot the things they pay for.</p>
<p>The more you can make somebody pay, the more they will love the thing they bought.</p>
<p>– Dan Gilbert, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwQFSc9mHyA">The Science of Happiness, What Your Mother Didn’t Tell You</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Call it a feature or a bug of your brain design, but you will value more those things that you work hard for.</p>
<p>Conversely, you will value free and easy things less <em>because</em> they came free and easy. It’s like your brain thinks that they must not be worth very much. I mean, if they had been worth a lot, why are they available so easily?</p>
<p>How much did you work for those movies? How much did you have to pay for those books? How much did you have to struggle before you could hear those songs?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<h1 id="paralysis-by-analysis">Paralysis by Analysis</h1>
<p>You have so many books, how many of them have you read?</p>
<p>I have this folder on my computer called “Books” (duh). There are over 600 books in there. How many of them have I actually finished? 6.</p>
<p>F*ck! I just took a look at the folder and my stress levels went up in an instant. There are hundreds of books out there. Books that I haven’t read despite having them for years now.</p>
<p>Does that remind you of something? It’s like those books are some kind of a <a href="./Fie-on-your-TODO-List.md">To-Do List</a>. Even though I haven’t written out on a piece of paper saying I want to read all those books, the mere fact that I considered them important enough to have on my hard drive makes my mind feel I ought to be reading all of them.</p>
<p>Like any good To-Do List, it is draining me of <a href="./How-much-Will-Power-do-you-have.html">Will Power</a> just by existing. And thus, it is making it more and more likely that I will never complete reading them, because my Will Power keeps dropping.</p>
<p>Just what we wanted.</p>
<p>And in this case, the situation is even worse than a To-Do List. There are so many awesome books in there, that I’m not able to choose which one I should take on next. Should I read this awesome book on basic Economics? Or this brilliant one on Psychology? Or this classic book on Programming? Or maybe that kickass introduction to… Dammit… I’m just gonna go watch some random movie.</p>
<p>The more choice you have, the worse your decision will be. This is called the Paradox of Choice. Lots more on this coming soon.</p>
<hr />
<p>What am I trying to get at here? Is Piracy awesome or not?</p>

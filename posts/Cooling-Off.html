<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What should we cool off about?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="what-would-you-do">What would you do?</h1>
<p>So, there are these times when I have a buttload of ideas unloaded on me out of nowhere by my unconscious. I’ve written about one time when I wasn’t <a href="./Portrait-of-the-Writer-as-an-Ignorant-Fool.html">able to sleep</a> because of the stuff that was hitting me between the eyes. I had a similar epiphany storm <a href="./Stop-Fcuking-Around.html">last night</a>. (I had just watched the new X-Men movie, if that is relevant here.)</p>
<p>You get an awesome idea. You think about it and you get more and more excited with every minute. It is such an awesome idea. You work yourself up into a frenzy. You even write an essay about it. And, as things go with essays, you end up generating even more awesome insights about the topic and get convinced how awesome it is.</p>
<p>What should you do?</p>
<p>Analyze your life’s actions and re-arrange them in light of this new epiphany? Create a Revolution in your life? Decide that this is gonna change <em>everything</em>?</p>
<p>Or just Cool Off?</p>
<h1 id="the-quintessential-human-emotion">The Quintessential Human Emotion</h1>
<p>Here’s the score. I think I’ve had one or two valuable insights in almost every essay I’ve written so far. Some of the essays have been absolute crap because I was writing them for others. But, apart from that, I’ve had genuine ideas. What came of them? I even added so-called “Keep It Real” actions at the end of many of them? Did I follow up on even a few?</p>
<p>Why is it that many of them didn’t really have an impact?</p>
<p>More importantly, why didn’t I <em>predict</em> that?</p>
<p>The problem isn’t that they didn’t have much of an impact. I’ve come to terms with that. It took me a while, but I’ve finally accepted that “Rationality”, as it stands, hasn’t <a href="./What-has-your-Rationality-done-for-you.html">really done too much for me</a> (or for anyone else).</p>
<p>So, the lack of Impact isn’t the real problem. It’s the <strong><em>hope</em></strong> I had. I genuinely felt that it would improve my life in some way. It made me feel good and stuff. But nothing came of it. And every time this happens, my faith in myself drops one more notch. It damning evidence for my mind which starts to think I’m an utter f*ck-tard who is incapable of executing on even the most easy and awesome of ideas. Not cool.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<h1 id="epiphanies-are-evil">Epiphanies are Evil</h1>
<p>Certain things seem to make a huge amount of sense in a certain context. When you go inside a casino or a strip club, there ain’t gonna be a single thought about your pending homework or whatever. Your mind will just be saying “Go go go!!! Enjoy yourself. Do [insert crazy thing here]”. And the very same thoughts seem completely retarded when you are away from those environments.</p>
<p>It’s like a movie shooting spot after the shooting is over. It is completely deserted. When you contrast with how alive it was a few hours ago, it feels even more desolate. All the awesome lights are gone, the music is gone, the buzzing people are gone, everything is gone. What is left is the shooting spot. It is still beautiful, just not quite as great as it was made to look when the shooting was on.</p>
<p>Epiphanies are like the insights or feelings of enlightenment that people have when they are on drugs. There’s nothing you can tell them to convince them that they’re just having silly visualizations in a state of mind where they are prone to take it as truth. Just like the things they see when they are high, your epiphanies too are most probably just delusions.</p>
<p>It is like our mind judges how <strong>true</strong> something is, by how strongly you <strong>feel</strong> it true.</p>
<p>The idea stays the same, the excitement doesn’t. And that is probably why things that <del>excited you like hell</del> seemed really true to you a long time ago, now just seem like weak truths. That is why the area of “self-improvement” sees cycles of fads every few years. The Power of Positive Thinking, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, Getting Things Done, Crap from Anthony Robbins, The Four-Hour Work-Week… it goes on. The real techniques of impactful thinking and behaviour have not changed, but people’s excitement about old techniques have changed. Hence, it is more about fashion than substance.</p>
<p>In short, epiphanies are like girls (for boys) - you can’t think straight around them. Any decision you take in their presence must now be <a href="http://hpmor.com/chapter/55">considered suspect, fallacious until proven valid</a>.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-left">What is left</h1>
<p>The truth is what is left after you’ve taken out all the crap.</p>
<p>Accept the truth. Embrace it. That is all there is in the world.</p>
<p>The only thing you can reliably trust is the data.</p>
<p>Your “idea” may seem awesome in the moment, you may be having a ball right now imagining all the awesome things that you’re gonna do, but you will come crashing down to reality after midnight with nothing to show for it, like Cinderella.</p>
<p>You’ve just had an epiphany? Great. Think about it at depth. Write an essay while everything is still fresh.</p>
<p>Then, Cool Off. Take a couple of days to go do other stuff (life will do this for you). Come back after a couple of days, preferably a week. How does that “epiphany” look now?</p>
<h1 id="v0.5">v0.5</h1>
<p>I started writing all this just to expound on something I just realized and, thereby, introduce v0.5 of The Great 300-Word Experiment.</p>
<p>v0.5 = Posts with editing.</p>
<p>Write post. Cool off. Come back. Edit it (aka rewrite, as we call it in the business). Publish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rewriting is the essence of writing.</p>
<p>– Thalaivar William Zinsser, On Writing Well</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was what I wanted to say. But, given that I’m not writing here to please others or to convince them or to even spread knowledge, that seemed a bit hollow. I am here <a href="./Stop-Fcuking-Around.html"><em>only</em> to generate ideas</a>. The more the better. The better the better. Nothing more, nothing less. Publishing online is mainly so that I am forced to explain clearly.</p>
<p>Rewriting seems like good advice for people who write novels or magazine articles or non-fiction books or whatever. I dunno. Paul Graham does lots and lots of rewriting, apparently. He has an <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/laundry.html">insanely awesome article</a> actually showing how he evolves his essays.</p>
<p>But, I wasn’t convinced it would be useful for generating ideas, which the only thing we care about here.</p>
<p>Then, it struck me. The rewriting part here is more to introduce Cooling Off than anything else. Perspective. When you write an essay and come back to read it after a week, for all practical purposes, it ain’t your essay anymore. It is written by somebody else. The data bears me out. I am routinely surprised by stuff I wrote even after just four days.</p>
<p>So, we’ll have epiphanies. We’ll have even more epiphanies by writing essays. But then, we’ll take a break. We’ll Cool Off, come back, and remove all the excitement-induced crap when we are sober. Yes, what you’re left with will be less exciting. It will be less cool. It won’t set your pants on fire. It won’t make you salivate every minute in your daydreams. But it will be the <em>truth</em>. And there ain’t anything more powerful. Epiphanies are Epic-Awesome, but they’re also Evil.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="ps">PS</h1>
<p>F*ck! I didn’t mean to think about epiphanies like that. No! I like epiphanies. I want to have them.</p>
<p>I Want my epiphanies! I want them!!! Give me my epiphanies… don’t take my epiphanies away from me… they’re so nice… and blissful… and life feels awesome when I have them… it feels like I will finally be able to solve all my problems once and for all… and get rid of all the pain and suffering I have in this motherf*cking world… Give me back my epiphanies…. Give it to me…</p>

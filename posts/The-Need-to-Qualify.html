<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What do you say when someone says “I don’t think you’re a very helpful person”?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="exhibit-1">Exhibit #1</h2>
<p>“I didn’t think you were a helpful-minded person.”</p>
<p>What would you do if a good friend of yours said that to you?</p>
<p>Without any sort of conscious effort on my part, my mind immediately summoned up a cart-load of arguments against the statement.</p>
<p>“Hey, that’s wrong. Tell him about that time you… [did some act of kindness]”</p>
<p>“Tell him about the people you’ve helped over the years…”</p>
<p>“Tell him about the time you went out of your way and …”</p>
<p>and another 50 such arguments showing how I am the King of Altruists. (“SPK really is! Tell them about that time…” - my mind right now)</p>
<p>I bit my tongue in time, though, and didn’t say anything. I just let it pass.</p>
<p>Ok. So, what’s my point?</p>
<p>On to the next exhibit.</p>
<h2 id="exhibit-2">Exhibit #2</h2>
<p>“I have seen a lot of the rural side of India. People who have grown up in cities all their lives have no clue about the <em>real</em> side of India. They don’t have any clue how much people are really suffering out there. I have seen…” - a friend says</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>Here’s what I did.</p>
<p>“Hey, no! You don’t know about me. I really care about the people who are suffering out there. I have seen a lot of the suffering of people out there. (‘He really has!’ - my mind says) Heck, I’ve been pretty poor my whole life. I have never had any real comforts in life. I’m not like those other city-grown-up people. I’m different. Really. I have struggled so much… blah blah blah…”</p>
<p>Facepalm.</p>
<p>If anyone wanted some embarrassment-dynamite to come and detonate in front of me anytime, the above paragraph is rich TNT. I’m deeply ashamed of what I did.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<h2 id="why-this-kolaveri">Why this Kolaveri?</h2>
<p>What really happened?</p>
<p>My friend was suggesting that I may not have some kind of qualities - like the helping tendency [citation needed], or concern about the poor people out there (somewhere), or knowledge about the “real” side of India.</p>
<p>What’s common about these?</p>
<p>Yup. They are all <strong>virtues</strong> (Something missing here? Oh, yeah… wait… here you go… [citation needed]). Ain’t nobody that wants to miss out on virtues.</p>
<p>Cool. But why was I facepalming afterwards? Why am I so ashamed of it? I mean, after all, I wasn’t lying when I said all those things. My mind was giving me truthful incidents from the past. What’s not to like?</p>
<p>When you say all these things, when you list out all the wonderful “virtuous” stuff you’ve done in the past, how do you <em>feel</em>? Do you get a <em>feeling</em> of great virtue? Your mind feels like it has achieved so much awesome stuff in the world. A halo practically forms above your head.</p>
<p>So what? Shouldn’t we feel good about good stuff we’ve done in the past?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How much “good stuff” done by you does it take to convince your mind that, Wow, you have done so much awesome stuff?</p></li>
<li><p>What about all the crap stuff you’ve done in the past? Where does that figure in the calculations?</p>
<p>Crap stuff? What crap stuff? I’m an Angel. Look at the halo above my head.</p></li>
<li><p>How much <strong>burning drive</strong> do you feel now to go out and do all the hard work needed to get real awesome impact on the world?</p>
<p>Why would your mind give you that much motivation anymore? According to it, you’ve already made it! You’ve reached the top as far as that virtue is concerned (“He really has!” - your mind says). Now, you can just kick back and relax.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>No Impact, No Right to Talk. No Right to kick back and relax in indulgent self-congratulation.</p>
<p>You have no right to say that you have some virtues unless you have created an impact in the world that implies those virtues. Else, it is just empty talk. (Is all talk empty talk? Is that why we focus so much on Action and Impact?)</p>
<h2 id="qualifying">Qualifying</h2>
<p>Ok. Cool. Now we know better. We won’t go and talk about awesome “virtuous” stuff we’ve done in the past. It will make our mind feel like it has already achieved enough stuff and will stop us having the motivation to go and do all the real hard work necessary.</p>
<p>Are we done?</p>
<p>What’s the title of this essay?</p>
<p>Why do we feel the need to Qualify when someone disqualifies us? Especially in fields related to virtues. When someone says or implies that we don’t have certain virtues, why do we feel the burning need to correct them and list out our achievements in that field?</p>
<p>Let’s answer that indirectly.</p>
<p>Will you ever hear anyone sensible saying “I’m <strong><em>not</em></strong> a good person”? Will you ever hear anyone saying “I don’t like to help others. It’s a waste of time. Other people are stupid idiots. F*ck them”?</p>
<p>In other words, it is predictable. Someone can easily make you try to convince them about your virtues by saying the opposite about you. In fact, they needn’t even say it out loud. If there is even the slightest chance that they might think something bad about you, your mind will <em>compel</em> you to go and correct their opinion. It will make you talk about awesome stuff you’ve done in the past. It will rest only when it is convinced that the other person doesn’t think too badly of you.</p>
<p>Ok. So, what’s the big deal?</p>
<p>Which means, <em>every</em> single time you talk to somebody about a topic involving virtues in any way, your mind will go hyper-active trying to make sure the other person has a good opinion of you. Which means, subtle or not, it will make you talk so that the other person thinks you have that virtue.</p>
<p>And then, what happens? Kaboom. Sayonara, burning motivation. Goodbye, Impact. Howdy, Imaginary Halo!! Welcome to my head.</p>
<h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>
<p>We have this burning need to Qualify. But Qualifying f*cks up our mind and f*cks up any Impact we could have in the future. And our mind can make us Qualify in subtle, unrecognizable ways when we talk to someone about a topic involving virtue.</p>
<p>So what do we do?</p>
<p>Take a gun and shoot our mind.</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>Which topics can make our mind Qualify? Which topics involve virtue in some way?</p>
<p>Politics? Charity? Is there something about “helping the people who are suffering out there (somewhere)” that brings out the best/worst in us?</p>
<p>(What is the “best” it brings out? What is the “worst” it brings out? It makes us talk about virtues. And thus, it f*cks up any Impact we could actually have had.)</p>
<p>Cool. So we need to be on our guard. Next time, the topic of “helping people” comes up, what should I do? Shut the F*ck Up. And then, if I really feel like it, go and make an Impact happen. What should I <em>not</em> do? Sit on my ass and talk about it.</p>
<p>Counter-argument: Won’t talking about good stuff actually make you feel like going out and doing something? Won’t it motivate you?</p>
<p>Hmmm… interesting idea. It could be, I guess. You tell me. You have spoken so many times to so many people about “good stuff”, I’m sure. What came of it? No Imp…</p>

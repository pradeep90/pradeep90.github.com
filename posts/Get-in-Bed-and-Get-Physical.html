<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: How do I keep to a good sleep cycle?</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Real quick post cos of circumstances.</p>
<h1 id="going-mental">Going Mental</h1>
<p>In “<a href="./Why-dont-I-go-to-bed-early.html">Why don’t I go to be early</a>”, I spoke about many of the reasons I don’t feel like shutting everything off and going to bed at some normal time like 11pm. Going to bed is boring, staying up late is cool, and the night is seductive. Plus, I don’t get to see the harm done to my body right away.</p>
<p>Cool. Just to be clear, these were the <em>psychological</em> problems I had been having, on top of any physical stuff.</p>
<p>Regarding physical sleepiness, I usually have no trouble feeling sleepy early when I workout. My eyes automatically start drooping at around 11pm. Great, right? That’s the solution right there!</p>
<p>But there’s many a slip between the cup and the lip. The problem is that even though I <em>feel sleepy</em>, I don’t go to bed immediately. “Just one more thing…” “Just one more paragraph…” I don’t want the party to stop. And so I push past the sleepy feeling. And, guess what, the sleepy feeling retreats into my mind. It doesn’t bother me again. It can’t <em>make</em> me go to bed.</p>
<p>And that is how I happen to stay up late even though I’m feeling tired and stuff. And that’s the best case. If I’m not tired at all, I’m screwed. It can go on all night.</p>
<p>Not cool. We are gonna fix this.</p>
<h1 id="cycles">Cycles</h1>
<p>What are some major factors in deciding whether you will <em>actually</em> go to sleep?</p>
<p>First off, it seems that our body has some inner clock that it uses to keep time. Our wall-clock tells us when to go to office or when to go to a meeting or when to watch some show. This inner clock tells our body when to feel sleepy and when to feel fresh and awake and stuff.</p>
<p>It seems there are two processes in our brain - one wants 8 hours and the other wants 16 hours. Together, they make up the whole day. 24 hours. So, when the first one tries to exceed around 8 hours, the second process tries to kick it out and start itself. And, similarly, when the second process exceeds 16 hours, the first process tries to get back in.</p>
<p>The first process runs basically when we sleep. It needs us to be at rest and not doing our daily crap stuff. It does all kinds of stuff in the brain and the body - you know, upkeep and maintenance. The other process runs when we are awake. It takes care of all the awake stuff. Gives you energy to do all the activities and stuff.</p>
<p>So, there is a beautiful natural balancing cycle going on in our body all the time. Go without sleep for too long, and the sleep process will kick in and force you to compensate with enough sleep. Sleep for too long and the awake process will make you wake up and get back to life.</p>
<p>In “<a href="./Why-dont-I-go-to-bed-early.html#the-alarm-is-silent">The Alarm is Silent</a>” section, I showed how I’m almost certainly being inefficient and unproductive at night. So, let’s agree for now that a 10pm-6am sleep cycle is better than a 2am-10am sleep cycle, not least because there are many things in life that would need me to wake up at 8am or earlier.</p>
<p>I am sleeping for around 8 hours everyday, it’s just that the whole cycle is shifted out of sync with the natural order of things.</p>
<p>How does that happen? What can affect our internal clock?</p>
<h1 id="dinner-is-ready">Dinner is Ready</h1>
<p>I think one major thing that our body uses to set its internal clock is the timing of our meals.</p>
<p>This is just a theory of mine and I don’t have any research to back it up. Just my own personal data, plus I saw it mentioned somewhere online. Nothing official.</p>
<p>(Let’s look at the problem in more detail!)</p>
<p>Firstly, how can we discover which factors are causing my internal clock to be out of sync?</p>
<p>What differs between me and my past self? More explicitly, what differs between me and others who maintain good sleep cycles?</p>
<p>It was only over the past couple of weeks that I noticed people getting surprised about my meal timings. One friend heard that I was gonna go have lunch at 4:30pm and was quite concerned for me. I was like, dude!, if you think this is bad… I’ve had “lunch” at 5:30pm every weekend for the last three months. “Breakfast” at 12 noon or 1pm, whenever I woke up.</p>
<p>Some other friend heard that I was having dinner, at around 11:45pm, and was again concerned. I was amused, but there was a vague unease at the back of my mind.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="ethir-neechal">Ethir Neechal</h1>
<p>(translation: Swimming against the current)</p>
<p>There is a really good reason why we feel a lot of internal angst and discomfort when we go against the crowd. Because most of the time, you’re probably wrong. Yes, if you think straight about it and keep your eyes peeled open for the truth, you can increase your chances of success, as we will endeavour to do in our <a href="./All-the-difference-in-the-world.html">non-normality</a> actions! But, most of the time, humans will automatically fail when they go against the default.</p>
<p>These alarm bells didn’t ring for me! F*ck! That is what I really meant by“<a href="./Why-dont-I-go-to-bed-early.html#the-alarm-is-silent">The Alarm is Silent</a>”. It never <em>felt</em> wrong! Inside of me, it just seemed normal… nothing wrong…</p>
<p>You have already figured out the major problem. My meal timings are way off. Practically every single person I know keeps to a “proper” breakfast at 8, lunch at 12, and dinner at 8 (or some close variant).</p>
<p>I’m guessing our body uses the meal timings to decide when to start the sleep cycle and stuff. Like, if I have breakfast at 12 noon everyday, and “lunch” at 4pm everyday, and then dinner at 10:30pm… my body expects that I will sleep at around 2am and then wake up at around 10am or something. And it cooperates. It doesn’t know any better. It doesn’t have access to my wall-clock.</p>
<h1 id="v-for-vicious">V for Vicious</h1>
<p>So, meal timings are possibly very important. How will I find out for sure if they really are? By taking a couple of weeks or so to set my meal timings right and then seeing if it gets me the Impact I want.</p>
<p>Note: There are other <em>physical</em> factors affecting sleep cycles, but this seemed to be the biggest and most obvious problem for me.</p>
<p>Worst of all, the other psychological habits I spoke of merely reinforce this shifting of my internal clock. Cos going to bed early is boring, I keep postponing my bedtime and keep pushing all activities later and later into the night, including dinner. Which means I wake up later and have breakfast later… Hmmm… this is what they call a Vicious Cycle.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<hr />
<p><del>Action: Eat breakfast at or before 10am. Have lunch at or before 2pm. Have dinner at or before 9pm.</del></p>
<p>Why did I strike that out? Has it got something to do with a… ahem… some kind of <a href="./Fie-on-your-TODO-List.html">list</a>?</p>
<p>How else do I make it happen?</p>
<p>We’ll see. No pressure.</p>
<p>Remember what we understood from “<a href="./The-Idea-Bank.html">The Idea Bank</a>” - we need to look at essays as Idea Banks, not To-Do Lists… When I’m ready, when I desperately want to fix my sleep cycle, when I want it <em>real bad</em>, this idea will be waiting here for me.</p>
<p>What?! Is that how we’re gonna get insane awesome results? Are you nuts? Yup. It’s just an idea. More on this later.</p>

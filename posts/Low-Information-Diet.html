<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: WTF is a Low-Information Diet?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="lets-get-the-chitchat-out-of-the-way">Let’s get the chitchat out of the way</h2>
<p>Low-Information Diet simply means that you control the amount of information you consume the way you control the amount of crap you eat when you’re on a diet.</p>
<p>(h/t Tim Ferriss from whom I learnt this idea).</p>
<p>This is what I was talking about in the <a href="./What-does-it-mean-to-clarify-an-idea.html">last essay</a>. Ultra-Obvious Application #1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We shouldn’t be reading about ideas that will not improve our lives in any way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But these are all just words. What impact can it actual give us? What do I, le SPK, expect to gain from this fancy-sounding idea? Remember, <a href="./Who-should-you-respect.html">No A, No R to T</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-easy-targets">The easy targets</h2>
<p>Sure, there is a lot of material out there that won’t have any Ideas for you - no ways to improve your life in any way. Stuff like magazines, newspapers, blog posts, etc. I don’t read newspapers. Ever. Why? What about magazines? They’re printed on better paper. Surely they’re better? Nope. Why?</p>
<p>Really? Then, why are they in business? Surely people would have gained a lot of value from them? You know the test I’m gonna propose to you. Get data. And look hard at it. What data, you ask? Look at the decades of life behind you. Look at the decades of life in the millions of people who have read a newspaper every single day. What came of it?</p>
<p>Are they doing pretty much just as well (or poorly) as people who aren’t reading newspapers? Is it worth spending that much time reading the newspaper everyday? If there is no significant difference, you know the drill. No Impact, No Right to… read the newspaper.</p>
<p>Cool. But these are easy targets. And I’m not even making these mistakes right now (newspapers and magazines). If you look at them from a distance, it is obvious that they don’t have much to contribute to your life directly. The argument for them just crumbles under your intense scrutiny, like a weak batting order.</p>
<p>What else is left? These are all the resources that don’t have any ways to improve your life. Cool. We don’t read them. But the other stuff is all ok, right? They have ideas in them (otherwise, they would be in this list). What’s not to like?</p>
<h2 id="the-non-obvious-mistakes">The non-obvious mistakes</h2>
<p>Let’s look at the problem in more detail. What are we really trying to avoid?</p>
<p>We have very limited time on this planet. Need to do as well as possible to get what we want with the limited resources we have. Cannot afford to waste our time and energy on stuff that doesn’t get us to our goals. Our desires are essentially infinite. Resources are scarce. Hence, you have to make tradeoffs. We need to cut off all low-value uses of our time and resources.</p>
<p>Reading bullcrap was of the least value possible. Cool. Eliminated.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that we care <em>only</em> about results (like our happiness, good relationships, favourite IPL team’s success).</p>
<p>Hmmm… Could there be some kinds of resources that have “ideas” but don’t lead to results? Like what?</p>
<p>Say there’s an essay online about better and effective hygiene. It contains proven techniques that will reduce your future medical costs and ensure a better quality of life overall. If you aren’t able to implement those techniques right now, was it a waste of time reading that essay?</p>
<p>Think carefully before answering. We would call it a waste of time if it didn’t have an impact on your life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But it did give me ideas that I would go on and implement when my life became less busy. Really!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Come back and talk to me then. We’ve already seen about <a href="./Who-should-you-respect.html#potential-argument">potential</a> to do stuff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ll definitely keep it in my mind. It’s such an awesome idea. I definitely won’t forget it. You betcha ass I’ll implement it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>You</em> go betcha <em>your</em> ass on it. I’ve bet my own ass so many times that, hey, he refuses to lift any loads on his back any more. Remember the Leaky Bucket. You won’t remember great ideas. Depend on it.</p>
<p>If you’re still not convinced, hear me out. Imagine if I give you the key to a secret repository. This super-special storehouse contains the solution to pretty much every single problem you’re having right now. All you have to do is ask. Now, tell me if your life will immediately become a 100x as awesome.</p>
<p>You wanted Great Ideas? You got ’em. Real Ideas - stuff that reduces the cost at which you get your goals. Stuff that improves the quality of your life. It’s chock-full of them. Will you have reached Insane Awesome heights of power? Will you have improved in all the areas for which it provides solutions?</p>
<p>If you tried to think for a couple of seconds, you can even think of some real-life mini-equivalents of this repository that are available at an arm’s stretch from you. What are they? I dunno… maybe you can <em>Google</em> for them. Or look them up on <em>Wikipedia</em>.</p>
<h2 id="it-gets-personal">It gets personal</h2>
<p>Even better, you can ask your own mind. They say we don’t really forget all the stuff we think we forget. It’s somewhere “in there”, apparently. You have come across hundreds of great ideas in your past. What happened of them all?</p>
<p>Examples? I’ve come across awesome ideas to “Study Smarter, Not Harder”, “Read Better and Faster”, increase my “Word Power”, “Win Friends and Influence People”, think like an “Undercover Economist”, and utilize the “Magic of Thinking Big”.</p>
<p>I seriously think they contain some awesome ideas. And, what’s more, these are just a small fraction of the books I came across before my 11th standard, 8 years ago. I’m too ashamed to mention the 20x more awesome books that I have “read” more recently. What came of it? What impact has it had?</p>
<p>To be more concrete: “Study Smarter Not Harder” says that you should revise each class lecture’s content within the 5 minutes immediately after the lecture. This is a crucial period of time for consolidation of material, it says. I had nearly 7 years of classes and college after that. What did I do? You got it. Nothing. I just rushed out of the class like everyone else.</p>
<p>This is not about beating myself up. Hey! We don’t do that no more. This is about facts. We need to look at the truth squarely if we want to make sure we make an awesome impact in the future.</p>
<p>Make your own list. What awesome books have you read? What awesome talks have you heard? What awesome movies have you watched? What came of it all? Leaky Bucket, anyone?</p>
<p>I am convinced that there are genuinely awesome insights in each of the books I have read. And there are a lot more high-quality books out there, with a lot more high-quality ideas. And it is a matter of plain fact that executing those actions will leave you better off. No two ways about it. The guy who consistently reviews immediately after class will have measurably higher recall and understanding than the guy who just clicks the off button in his head as the class hour ends. The first guy will reliably whoop the second guy’s ass. We need to be doing more of such things.</p>
<p>Why aren’t we?</p>
<h2 id="resources-to-avoid">Resources to avoid</h2>
<p>Ok. So what really is the answer to our earlier question? How can resources <em>with</em> Ideas be a waste of our time?</p>
<p>We’ve seen the data now. Not cool. So, instead of answering directly, here are some questions - “You have a butt-load of ideas that you haven’t taken any action on. Do you really need the 1057th idea coming from this next blog post online? Is it just gonna join all the other ideas on the waste-heap?”</p>
<p>The answer is <strong>not</strong> <em>more</em> ideas. We have a lot of ideas already. We’re just not implementing them.</p>
<p>What actions do we take? More on this soon.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="quick-ps">Quick PS</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Speed</p>
<p>54 minutes, 1388 words. Started off fast in the first 20 minutes. Then, slowed down to ponder over some ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>Surprises?</p>
<p>Classification of resources with ideas that we can’t (or don’t) implement.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What other kinds of resources are left?</p>
<p>The answer is not more ideas. We have LOTS of ideas already. Simply adding more ideas is not gonna solve the problem.</p>
<p>The Low-Information Diet follows automatically.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Peace. Take care.</p>

<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What is the difference between some classic all-time great movies and the current movies?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="so-far">So Far</h1>
<p>We’ve seen how humans don’t really value things they <a href="./The-Perks-of-Piracy.html">haven’t worked hard</a> for. This happens whether you want it or not. Then, when you <a href="./The-Compare-and-Contrast-Effect.html">compare</a> something with others that are as good or better, they all suffer. All of them seem worse than they were.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some more problems that prevent us from being as entertained / educated as we can be.</p>
<h1 id="adapters-and-plugs">Adapters and Plugs</h1>
<p>Humans adapt. We won’t always find something insanely attractive and interesting. Things become boring. That is the way of life. Nothing stays interesting forever.</p>
<p>You can see this in many ways. You may have a playlist full of songs that set you abuzz right now. A couple of months from now, it is a good bet that more than half those songs would have been replaced. A year from now, none of them will still be your favourites. This is why we have the term “current favourites”.</p>
<p>Similarly for movies, you see an awesome movie and you go ga-ga over it. I kept telling everyone what an awesome movie “The Matrix” was. I only saw it first three years ago. Everyone had seen it a long time ago and weren’t all that excited. Next, I was raving about James Bond and Casino Royale. Then, something else… and the story goes on…</p>
<p>What happened? Is The Matrix not awesome anymore? Of course not. It is awesome. It’s just that I will never again feel as <em>excited</em> about it as I did during that initial honeymoon period.</p>
<h1 id="every-movie-has-its-day">Every movie has its day</h1>
<p>This suggests that a movie or book or song has some critical period where your mind is really jacked up about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brutus:<br /></p>
<p>There is a tide in the affairs of men.<br /> Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;<br /> Omitted, all the voyage of their life<br /> Is bound in shallows and in miseries.<br /> On such a full sea are we now afloat,<br /> And we must take the current when it serves,<br /> Or lose our ventures.<br /> <br /> – Julius Caesar Act 4, scene 3, 218–224<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have only so much time before this current movie that you’re crazy about becomes ordinary to you. The magic is gonna wear off pretty soon. This movie is <em>never again</em> gonna seem this hot to you. So, if you want to squeeze out maximum entertainment and enjoyment out of it, you have to strike while the iron…</p>
<p>Milking the movie for all its worth takes time and attention. We need to think about it, mull over its significance, day-dream about dating the actress, fantasize about fighting like the actor, and just dissolve in the magic of the music.</p>
<p>How do we do that when we’re busy moving on to the next movie in our 500GB external hard drive?</p>
<p>How long does the movie even last in our head?</p>
<p>Of course, I’m not suggesting that we ought to take one movie and think about it for one whole year… that’s surely taking it too far (or is it?). But thinking about it for a grand total of 15 seconds, before pressing ENTER on the next movie?</p>
<p>Not cool.</p>
<p>The same goes for books, sitcoms, and songs.</p>
<h1 id="shallow-waters">Shallow waters</h1>
<p>We know now that there is a honeymoon period. What do we do in it? What are we <em>not</em> doing right now?</p>
<p>Having a butt-load of books and movies in your external hard drive means that the only things we read or watch are those that managed to grab our attention and keep it, out of the hundreds of options. Which means we’ll probably overlook books or movies that are a bit deeper, that require you to spend some more time contemplating it, maybe watching it again (after reading up more about it on Wikipedia and IMDB).</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Most people I know don’t even get the deeper significance of Pulp Fiction or Fight Club.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Oh yeah, it was kinda different. And yeah, it was funny and all… but it’s an ok movie.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question is not whether it is an “ok movie” or not, the point is - are you even judging it for what it really is? I’m no expert on movies. I’m not even trying to say I see things in movies people don’t. I am routinely shocked by the deeper analogies people bring out in stuff. I only half-got the deep analogy in Life of Pi. I missed one huge analogy in Gravity (at the end, when she lands on earth).</p>
<p>Cool. When I learn about them later, it increases my enjoyment of the movie. We want to experience the awesome emotions more, and if watching it more closely and paying it some individual attention and tender love and care will help us do that, cool. Let’s do it.</p>
<p>But, how will we do that when we have a giant To-Do List of movies sitting on our head (actually our external hard drive)? By watching lots of movies in a shallow manner, we are probably having less fun than a guy who just watches a few but really extracts the last bit of enjoyment in them.</p>
<p>Hmmm… we should try that. This is a honeymoon period, right? Anything goes. No inhibitions. Everything seems that much more exciting! We can do some crazy stuff. Finding out in-jokes about the characters, or details about the plot that you missed in the first viewing, or enjoying the layering… whatever… When in doubt, we need to do what a hard-core fanatic - a fan - would do!</p>
<p>Isn’t that bad? Isn’t that only for stupid idiots who have nothing better to do than track every bit of news about the movie and memorize endless trivia and stuff?</p>
<p>Nah. Remember, this is a honeymoon period. It is finite. This too shall pass. In a couple of weeks, or a month or so… this movie will be nothing to you. Cool. But it will have been insane fun while it lasted. And that is all you can ask for.</p>
<hr />
<p>However, simply ignoring the other movies while you watch one particular movie won’t be enough. Why?</p>
<h1 id="peaking-your-interest">Peaking your Interest</h1>
<p>Which movie is better - the one you’re watching or a classic movie you had watched three years ago?</p>
<p>The answer is obvious. The classic movie was way better! This movie is “<em>nothing</em>” compared to the classic.</p>
<p>The current movie we’re watching is always crap compared to the classics from a few years ago, right? Shit, those movies had so much better stories, or better songs, or better acting, or the actors were in their peaks, or it was more real, or whatever. These new movies that keep coming out are just try-hard.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Can you ever tell for sure whether an actor is at his peak right now?</p>
<p>Isn’t it that the peak is only visible in retrospect?</p>
<p>And if we respect films made by actors at their peak most (duh! they’re at their peak!), then it means that we won’t actually respect those films as we’re watching them!</p>
<p>They will be worthy of respect only when we look back on them. When they’re just released, we aren’t sure if this is really the actor’s peak.</p>
<p>In fact, isn’t that true of almost all great movies? Can you tell for sure whether this film is gonna be the best of this decade right away? It’s difficult right?</p>
<p>In retrospect, you can easily pick out the best hits of the 2000s.</p>
<p>So, classic movies suck when they’re current and don’t suck when they get old. And new movies suck, especially in comparison with the awesomeness of the classics.</p>
<h1 id="the-way-of-the-paper-warrior">The Way of the Paper Warrior</h1>
<p>Wait a minute! What did we mean by a Paper Warrior? Someone who doesn’t get tested, somebody like a cricket commentator, who can say he is as good as he likes - nothing to contradict him.</p>
<p>Well, the “classic” movies are exactly Paper Warriors. We aren’t testing them right now. Therefore, they can be infinitely awesome. “Oh my god! That pairing… what chemistry! Ultimate!” “OMG! [Insert favourite music director] was really at his peak then!” and so on.</p>
<p>This current movie you’re watching, well it’s being tested like hell! Not only is every single one of the negative effects working on it, you can very <em>clearly</em> see how much Impact it is having on you.</p>
<p>And one of the most important facts of life is that, pretty much <em>nothing</em> ever truly sets our pants on fire. In real time, whatever we experience is basically pretty much ordinary stuff. The only “insane awesome experiences” that exist are in your memories! When it is happening, it is Merely Real. Great, but not actually earth-shattering.</p>
<p>Yes, there is magic, and you feel the emotions and stuff… but you come back down to earth pretty soon. Life goes on. And you can see that very vividly with the current movie you watched. But, with the classic movie, hey! You don’t remember exactly how much Impact it had. And, with time, and all the adoration that everybody else is also heaping, plus the fact that the actor was at his peak (in retrospect), … wow! What a movie! Unbelievable! I haven’t seen another one like it.</p>
<p>In other words, nothing we’re watching right away can compare to the classics, not even the classics themselves when we’re watching them. This means that we <em>remember</em> an Insane Awesome Movie Experience that we <strong>didn’t</strong> actually have, and then we use that Epic Experience to beat the shit out of any movie we’re currently watching, making sure we never will come close to having the experiences we are capable of having.</p>

<p>We’ve been speaking a lot about Piracy and Low-Information Diet. So, what are some ways to fight back and reclaim our rightful entertainment?</p>

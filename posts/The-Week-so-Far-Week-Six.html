<p>This is gonna be a quickie.</p>

<h1 id="akrasia"><a href="./Akrasia.html">Akrasia</a></h1>
<p>This week, we started looking at the area of Will Power.</p>
<p>Akrasia is a problem that we all suffer from. Weakness of will. Acting against our best judgement.</p>
<p>I don’t know what to write about.</p>
<p>The recap questions for Akrasia are at the end of that post.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="how-much-will-power-do-you-have"><a href="./How-much-Will-Power-do-you-have.html">How much Will Power do you have?</a></h1>
<h4 id="why-dont-we-get-stuff-done-even-though-we-have-the-ability">Why don’t we get stuff done even though we have the ability?</h4>
<p>We run out of *ill Power. (Chill Power?)</p>
<h4 id="how-do-you-find-out-if-something-is-true">How do you find out if something is true?</h4>
<p>You *est it.</p>
<h4 id="in-the-experiment-conducted-by-roy-baumeister-what-was-the-idea-he-wanted-to-test">In the experiment conducted by Roy Baumeister, what was the idea he wanted to test?</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>People like cookies more than radish</p></li>
<li><p>People like radish because it is healthy</p></li>
<li><p>People who eat radish are more disciplined</p></li>
<li><p>People who exert Will Power will have **** of it left. (more | less)?</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-could-you-test-that-idea">How could you test that idea?</h4>
<p>So, the hypothesis is that people who exert Will Power have less left.</p>
<p>Make people exert their Will Power and then test their Will Power later to see who has less Will Power.</p>
<h4 id="how-did-they-make-one-group-exert-will-power">How did they make one group exert Will Power?</h4>
<p>By making them eat a ****** instead of a *****.</p>
<h4 id="why-does-that-make-you-exert-your-will-power">Why does that make you exert your Will Power?</h4>
<p>Cos you have to resist the temp******. (temporary?)</p>
<h4 id="how-did-they-test-their-will-power-at-the-end">How did they test their Will Power at the end?</h4>
<p>By seeing who tried for longer on a problem that was secretly impossible.</p>
<h4 id="which-group-lasted-longer-cookie-group-or-the-radish-group">Which group lasted longer? Cookie group or the Radish group?</h4>
<p>The ****** group.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-first-rule-of-truth-seeking">What is first rule of Truth-Seeking?</h4>
<p>You do not talk about Truth-Seeking.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-the-second-rule-of-truth-seeking">What is the second rule of Truth-Seeking?</h4>
<p>You <strong>do not</strong> talk about Truth-Seeking.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion-will-power-is">Conclusion: Will Power is</h4>
<p>infinite, right?</p>
<p>We can use it as much as we want and we will never run out.</p>
<p>Just keep piling on the tough decisions and the hard work.</p>
<p><code>&lt;/sarcasm&gt;</code></p>
<h4 id="what-is-the-technical-term-for-this-drainage-of-will-power">What is the technical term for this drainage of Will Power?</h4>
<p>ogE Depletion.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="fie-on-your-to-do-list"><a href="./Fie-on-your-TODO-List.html">Fie on your To-Do List</a></h1>
<h4 id="you-will-never-be-able-to-finish-your">You will never be able to finish your</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>novel</p></li>
<li><p>toothpaste</p></li>
<li><p>math homework</p></li>
<li><p>To-Do List</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="why">Why?</h4>
<p>Cos the more the people, the (more | less) the amount of cake for each one.</p>
<h4 id="why-does-the-very-existence-of-a-to-do-list-make-it-unlikely-that-you-will-succeed-at-your-existing-tasks">Why does the very existence of a To-Do List make it unlikely that you will succeed at your existing tasks?</h4>
<p>Cos each of them will add to the load in your mind and you will have to take decisions about how to tackle them.</p>
<h4 id="what-does-that-do">What does that do?</h4>
<p>Having to make such decisions depletes your W*** P****.</p>
<h4 id="so-is-it-only-about-having-less-items-scheduled-on-your-to-do-list">So, is it only about having less items scheduled on your To-Do List?</h4>
<p>No. It is about having less demanding w**k scheduled.</p>
<h4 id="what-do-i-suspect-depletes-will-power">What do I suspect depletes Will Power?</h4>
<p>Going against your imp****s (impalas?).</p>
<h4 id="what-is-partly-a-solution-for-this-problem">What is partly a solution for this problem?</h4>
<p>We need to demand more of ourselves?</p>
<p>Nah. We have to set**e for less.</p>
<h4 id="is-it-only-about-the-stuff-you-write-down-in-your-to-do-list">Is it only about the stuff you write down in your To-Do List?</h4>
<p>Could you get away with having stuff in your mind?</p>
<p>Nah.</p>
<h4 id="hmmm-what-if-you-dont-think-about-it-and-it-is-sorta-at-the-back-of-your-mind-can-you-get-away-with-that">Hmmm… what if you don’t think about it and it is sorta at the back of your mind? Can you get away with that?</h4>
<p>Nope.</p>
<h4 id="why-not">Why not?</h4>
<p>Cos it still counts as demanding something of yourself and thus you will need to exert Will Power for it. And thus your Will Power will be de**eted (deleted?).</p>
<h4 id="if-you-had-dreams-about-becoming-super-rational-in-the-future-and-achieving-every-thing-you-wanted-to-what-should-you-do">If you had dreams about becoming super-“rational” in the future and achieving every thing you wanted to, what should you do?</h4>
<p>Rock on and make it happen?</p>
<p>Forget about it. Ain’t gonna happen. Ever.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="ps">PS</h1>
<p>That’s all folks! Gotta go to bed.</p>

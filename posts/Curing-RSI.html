<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What was really causing my RSI?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="oct-25">Oct 25</h1>
<p>I find a link called “How I cured my RSI” by some guy. I expect it to be some crackpot stuff. Or maybe a satire or something. Nah. It was serious. Wait, is this guy legit?</p>
<p>I looked him up. Guy’s been to YCombinator and had his startup bought by Google. Whoa. Almost surely NOT a crackpot who believes in woo-woo stuff.</p>
<p>I follow another link and go to a similar post on another blog.</p>
<p>They claim that their RSI was cured with a day or two of reading the Mind-Body Approach book. What. The. F*ck.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, I search for RSI and Mind-Body Approach and get similar posts at exactly the same level of Rave. I’ve never seen people claim such terrific results with a straight face. I’m still suspicious.</p>
<p>But… goddammit… my pain is already gone. I f*ck you not. This is gonna be hard to believe. I’m a goddamn Aspiring Rationalist myself. I am highly skeptical of miracle cures.</p>
<p>It’s like a switch has flipped in my mind. The pain has just instantly gone off. No slow retreat. No dragged out process. Just gone… like that. Finished.</p>
<p>Holy Crap! Could it be true? Was the whole chronic pain thing just in my own head?</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>All</em> pain is in your head. But usually it correlates with some damage to your body. This pain was not correlating. It was out of sync.</p>
<p>It wasn’t like I bought the whole story and <em>then</em> the pain went away. Even as I was reading the posts, the pain was on its way out. It was like the <em>mere thought</em> of this pain just being a mental creation drove it away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Dumbledore’s been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!”</p>
<p>– Tom Riddle, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just <em>questioning</em> its validity seemed to make the pain go away. What is going on here?</p>
<h1 id="later-that-day">Later that day</h1>
<p>For the first time in years, I did not approach my keyboard with fear. I had the feeling that it would not be hurtful, and it wasn’t. F*ck.</p>
<p>It didn’t hurt.</p>
<h1 id="how-did-this-happen">How did this happen?</h1>
<p>They say that the mere act of approaching something with fear and stress makes you start having pain in that area.</p>
<p>Stress and other factors. Major.</p>
<h1 id="oct-26">Oct 26</h1>
<p>I typed out about a thousand words on my keyboard. There were times when it seemed like the pain would be back or something… but nah! I typed for 3 f*cking hours and nothing bad happened. Holy crap. At each point, I was half-expecting a bomb to drop and explode my hands away. Nope. It was fine. Mild sensation. But no pain. It was nothing like the last one year. I had never typed pain-free anytime in that whole period.</p>
<h1 id="oct-27">Oct 27</h1>
<p>Have been writing and typing almost non-stop since 10am. Nothing bad has happened. Yo!</p>
<p>I plan to fork out some money to buy the Mind-Body Approach book. It deserves the Rs 587 just for the past couple of days.</p>
<h1 id="oct-29">Oct 29</h1>
<p>Pretty much no pain at all while typing. I have this weird foreboding that I’m gonna feel pain, I’m gonna feel pain… but nothing happens.</p>
<p>I’ve been typing away merrily the whole day. Nothing bad has happened. Yay!</p>
<h1 id="nov-13">Nov 13</h1>
<p>Absolutely no pain at all! Holy motherf*cking crap!</p>
<p>It’s like my hands are soft petals. There’s just no pain at all. Life is awesome!!!</p>
<p>Thank you, Dr. John E. Sarno.</p>

<h2 id="do-things-that-hurt-earlier-apparently-cos-of-my-rsi">Do things that hurt earlier (apparently cos of my RSI)</h2>
<p>What activities was I avoiding due to RSI? If they don’t hurt now, it means that my “RSI” really has been cured.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Like bending my hand at the wrist - I got tingling earlier</p></li>
<li><p>Doing that weird anti-RSI shoulder stretch at the doorway</p></li>
<li><p>Typing on the smartphone or tablet screen</p></li>
<li><p>Using the mouse or mousepad</p></li>
<li><p>Holding a book by its edge with my fingers - I used to feel pain after a short while</p>
<p>In fact, holding anything with just my fingers hurt.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I was afraid of doing these things. I was stressed about them and according to this new hypothesis, that is why I was feeling pain. Now I shouldn’t feel pain.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="further-topics">Further Topics</h1>
<p>What is the exact hypothesis?</p>
<p>What is the alternate hypothesis? (The structural hypothesis)</p>
<p>What are the differing predictions?</p>
<p>Can it explain all the stuff I’ve been through? Examples?</p>

            <h2 id="approval-seeking-and-jealousy">Approval-Seeking and Jealousy</h2>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>I’m struggling with this myself. I’m writing all this out to clarify it in my own mind. Plus, it might be helpful to you, my dear reader, too as I slowly chip away at the dirt and get to the true solutions.</p>
<p>Note, however, that I have ABSOLUTELY no doubt that we will be able to find a solution to this. I am ABSOLUTELY confident that in ten years’ time, this will be as much of a problem as small pox is.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Why? What gives me that confidence? Is it the R-word? What specifically?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="whats-your-problem-man">What’s your problem, man?</h2>
<p>So what if you feel some jealousy sometimes? So what if you feel like impressing other people or “getting their approval” once in a while?</p>
<p>What’s your problem with that, man?</p>
<p>You tell me.</p>
<p>If you feel ok with all that, and you feel it’s not gonna affect your life satisfaction level much, cool. Go right ahead.</p>
<p>No need for you read this unless you’re feeling the pain. So, yeah, go ahead on your path. We humans are notorious for not taking any action until the pain forces us to screech to a halt and go for repair.</p>
<h2 id="the-root-of-this-trouble">The root of this trouble</h2>
<p>What is the most important problem we face when trying to avoid seeking approval and feeling jealousy?</p>
<p>In other words, what drives us towards that behaviour? Why can’t we just walk away?</p>
<p>You know, yeah, he or she is not giving you much attention. So what? Why are you not able to say “Big deal” and just get on with your work?</p>
<p>Yes, those guys don’t think too much of you. So what? Why can’t you just focus on whatever else you are interested in? Why do you feel the need to do stuff to impress them?</p>
<hr />
<p>What? You thought those were rhetorical questions?</p>
<p>Come up with your best answers.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here’s my attempt - What stops you from walking away…</p>
<p>… is the feeling that it will be <strong>unbearable</strong> for you if those guys disapproved of you / didn’t like you / thought you sucked / liked somebody else, etc.</p>
<p>Life wouldn’t be worth living. It feels like if they didn’t think you were awesome and cool, you would be living all alone in an infection-ridden dirt-poor sub-Saharan country instead of a nice comfortable apartment in a good developing country with all your friends and family.</p>
<p>It sounds ridiculous, I guess, but nobody is laughing. It really does feel that way to us.</p>

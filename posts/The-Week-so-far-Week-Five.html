<h1 id="what-have-i-written-about">What have I written about?</h1>
<p>The various in-progress <a href="../sequences.html">Sequences</a> - Hard Problems, Writing, Revenge or Grow, Impact and Action.</p>
<p>Have I been taking action on these? Has there been an impact on my life?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hard Problems</p>
<p>Haven’t tackled too many real-world problems, actually. The major change has been that I have <a href="./What-is-holding-you-back.html">decided</a> to take on important problems head-on in my essays. So, that’s something, I guess.</p></li>
<li><p>No Impact, No Right to Talk</p>
<p>This seems to be having the most Impact on my life :P. Lots of stuff going on. Can’t say anything right now.</p></li>
<li><p>Revenge or Grow</p>
<p>This has been a clear win. I have constantly pressed Grow at work and when dealing with <del>idiots</del> people whose behaviour <em>seems</em> irritating to me for some reason.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<p>Hey! This is the 37th essay in a row. 41,000 words and counting. Insights and Keep it Real actions coming out from all of them. ’nuff said.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="essays-and-action">Essays and Action</h1>
<p>I get the feeling that I will take Action on whatever I’ve written solidly in my essays.</p>
<p>Doesn’t mean I won’t do stuff I haven’t written about in my essays. Just means that writing about something makes it way more likely that I will take action on it.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: If you want to get Important Stuff done, write about it!</p>
<p>Cool. Here goes nothing.</p>
<h1 id="what-are-the-most-important-problems-in-my-life-right-now">What are the most important problems in my life right now?</h1>
<p>Like, if some genie were to come and just solve all these for me, life would be that much more awesome!</p>
<p>We can’t talk about goals without quantifying them. Resources are scarce. We need to make tradeoffs. Hence, we need to be able to prioritize goals. And because we are Impact-based Thinkers, we are going to prioritize goals <em>strictly</em> based on the Impact they will have. Nothing else.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I want to wake up at 7am in the morning regularly (with 8 hours of sleep)</p>
<p>I’m getting the 8 hours of sleep already. So, it’s just the waking up early bit. It feels like it will have an insane impact if I achieve that. But will it really?</p>
<p>I doubt it. Seriously. No Impact, No Right to Talk.</p>
<p>The main reason I want this is that, right now, I beat myself up everyday for <a href="./Early-to-bed-Early-to-rise.html">staying up late</a>. Hmmm… Maybe the solution isn’t to wake up at dawn. Maybe it’s about going easy on myself. I mean, if my life isn’t going to be that much better after waking up early, why beat myself up for not waking up early.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: I do need to take care of the health impacts, though. I need to cut down the time I spend late at night. Slowly. 30 minutes at a time. Without cursing myself in the process.</p>
<p>How do I go easy on myself?</p>
<p>Ok. Let’s say we don’t expect to be sleeping at <em>11pm</em> (Ha!) anytime in the next one month. Ain’t gonna happen anyway. So, turning off my computer at <em>1am</em> is ok. Not great, but not the end of the world either.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to go to the gym 3x a week</p>
<p>Cool. This is an all-time winner. I will sleep better, feel better, think better, and, yeah, look better. This has proven Impact.</p>
<p>This is right up there on the list.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to do cardio everyday</p>
<p>I’m not sure about this. I guess it will help me lose more weight. I’m already cycling around quite a bit.</p>
<p>Ok. The main problem is that I feel a perfect life would involve me waking up at 7am and then doing cardio for 30 minutes. I don’t wake up at 7am, so I don’t do the cardio in the morning. And in the evening, I tell myself that I’m going to be doing cardio in the morning from the next day onwards and so I shouldn’t break the rhythm or something.</p>
<p>Bullcrap. What has the Impact been? For the past 2 weeks I pretty much haven’t done cardio at all. Compared to doing it every single f*cking day in the evening for the 3 weeks before that. Not cool.</p>
<p>So. It’s decided. On the days I’m not going to the gym, I’m gonna do cardio in the evening after work. It’s pretty easy and I don’t have to go out of my way to do it (unlike the gym). Just do it while watching some awesome talks.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to write an awesome essay everyday</p>
<p>Strike the awesome part. Too much <a href="./Quantity-over-Quality.html">pressure</a>. Bad for the liver.</p>
<p>Things are just about heating up right now on this website. I’m going to get started on my first major Sequence tomorrow. So, yeah, I’m going ahead with The Great 300-Word Experiment.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>What else? I’ve mentioned all the usual suspects. But, truth be told, these are just the starters. What is the main course? What do I <em>really</em> care about? What is the stuff that I would weep over if I didn’t make any progress in it after one year?</p>
<p>What should I do about them? Should I wait for the perfect day to arrive when I wake up at 7am and have become “fit” and have written “well” and stuff?</p>
<p>Or should I just go ahead and take a tiny little bit of action on them everyday, without pressure regarding <a href="./Quantity-over-Quality.html">quality</a>? Sounds a bit like our good ol’ 300-Word Experiment? Lots more on this, coming soon.</p>

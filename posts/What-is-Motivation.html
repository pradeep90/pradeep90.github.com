<h1 id="what-is-motivation">What is Motivation?</h1>
<p>What does it mean to “have a lot of Motivation” for a particular topic or activity?</p>
<p>Well, Motivation for a particular action is the level of desire you feel for taking that action. And the action you will do at any point of time is the one for which you feel the most desire - the action with highest Motivation.</p>
<p>I think it works like this - your mind comes up with a bunch of possible actions you can take. And then, among them, it chooses the one for which you feel maximum Motivation.</p>
<p>So, the chance of some action being executed is the product of the chance of it being considered as a possible action by your mind and then the chance of it having maximum Motivation among the other possible actions.</p>
<p>Therefore, we need to increase the chances of some action being considered possible and the chances of it having maximum Motivation among the possible actions.</p>
<h1 id="its-impossible">It’s Impossible</h1>
<p>It is possible to know of some action but not consider it possible. For example, you might want to become a decent amateur film-maker but think it impossible to get all the equipment and experience and contacts and whatnot necessary. But, you could always start writing out some short film scripts and shooting with some random camera at first. You could use that to build some sort of experience and familiarity, while researching more and more about film-making on the side. But you don’t do any of that, cos you just don’t think it possible.</p>
<p>Ditto for solving hard problems, starting a business, quitting your day job and doing the work you really care about, etc.</p>
<p>Maybe the initial criteria for your mind is whether some action is “worthwhile”. Does it seem to be possible? If so, does it seem to have value?</p>
<h1 id="writing-things-off">Writing things off</h1>
<p>I suspect that your mind collects its list of “possible” actions from the past thoughts you have labelled as possible in your mind. If in the past you came across some action and it struck you as worthwhile, if you had high Motivation for it, then it would linger in your brain. Even if you didn’t do that action then, it would come up for consideration some other time. It is more readily available to your mind.</p>
<p>But if you had earlier dissed some action, if you had low Motivation for it, if you thought it wasn’t worthwhile, your mind would write it off. It won’t come up again in your thoughts for re-evaluation. Which means, even if it becomes possible now based on new information, it still won’t be considered. The only way you will consider that idea again is if some external cue reminds you of it again.</p>
<p>This is similar to the once-hopeful film-maker who hasn’t been making any films cos he thinks it’s too costly or something and fails to notice the dropping costs and simplicity of digital cameras and stuff. The excuses he had made earlier may no longer be valid at all. But unless he is thinking about film-making regularly or is reading some blogs or whatever on the topic, he won’t even notice this happening.</p>
<h1 id="idea-blindness">Idea blindness?</h1>
<p>Maybe the same thing is at work with startup ideas. Paul Graham mentions how people always think some new platform is a toy product and it will never be powerful enough for serious work. They are proven wrong later. It happened with micro-computers - considered worthy only for computer hobbyists. The internet - can’t be used for anything serious or really useful (ha! Everything is on the internet now). Smartphones - can’t be used for anything serious. Not powerful enough. Yeah, right.</p>
<p>I think it happened that people had low Motivation about these ideas in their infancy and so never really gave them too much thought. These ideas were out of their mind. So, even when things changed and these ideas were really powerful and <em>possible</em>, they never noticed until it hit them between the eyes. By then, it was too late to cash in.</p>
<p>I think the lesson here would be to not write things off as impossible and then ignore them forever. We need to keep them active and keep updating our Motivation for them based on new evidence about their worth.</p>
<h1 id="useful-tip">Useful Tip</h1>
<p>I think we should taboo the word Motivation. Instead, use the word Excitement!</p>
<p>A video game doesn’t give you some dumb “<em>Motivation</em>”. It just gets you f*cking excited about it. You do the rest. (The same thing happens with your preferred sex, btw.)</p>
<p>So, it’s The Excitement Equation.</p>
<p>Is this always applicable?</p>
<h1 id="the-fundamental-question-of-motivation">The Fundamental Question of Motivation</h1>
<p>Are you <em>excited</em> about doing X?</p>
<p>If not, you can’t really congratulate yourself about having increased Motivation like hell.</p>
<p>Are you <em>bored</em> with X?</p>

<p><strong>Entry Question</strong>: What makes your Map closely reflect the Territory?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="map-vs-territory">Map vs Territory</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Territory = Set of Events</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Map = Predictions for those Events</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example: Who’s gonna win the match tomorrow (Event in the Territory)? My guess: India 80%, Australia 20% (Map).</p>
<p>In reality, only one thing is gonna happen in that event (either India wins or Australia wins), just like there’s only thing in each geographical location in the territory (either a mountain or a river or a forest, whatever). However, you don’t know what is there. So, in your predictions (your Map), you guess.</p>
<h1 id="prediction-constrained-anticipation">Prediction = Constrained Anticipation</h1>
<p>You cannot say Dhoni will hit a six with 90% probability and then say he will hit a four with 90% probability. If you assign 90% probability to hitting a six, you only have 10% probability left for all the other outcomes. Deal with it.</p>
<p>You have 100% of probability. Spread it out among the outcomes. You cannot have more than 100% of probability in your predictions. That’s what it means to have Constrained Anticipation.</p>
<p>What do you anticipate? What do you expect to see? You cannot expect to see a six and, at the same time, expect to see a four. Your expectations are <em>constrained</em>. You cannot expect to see every possible outcome. Expecting to see one outcome reduces your expectations for another. In other words, you cannot have your cake and eat it too.</p>
<p>What this means is, you cannot say “I told you so” no matter what happens.</p>
<p>You have to leave yourself open to <a href="./Truth-Predictive-Power.html#surprise-surprise">surprise</a>. If some low probability outcome happens, you have to suck it up. You cannot say “Oh… I predicted that too”. No, you didn’t.</p>
<p>This is how you can make “predictions” about stuff in the past too. You just say how your anticipation about those events is constrained.</p>
<h1 id="reflecting-the-territory">Reflecting the Territory</h1>
<p>Incorporating our understanding of Prediction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Map = Anticipation-Constraints about the Events in the Territory</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: your Map could be wrong. You could have the wrong anticipations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Map reflects Territory = High Prediction Score</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have high <a href="./Truth-Predictive-Power.html">Predictive Power</a> for the events in the Territory</p>
<p>Your Map contains your final predictions about the events in the Territory You get it by combining the predictions of all your <a href="./Hypothetically-Speaking.html">hypotheses</a>, weighted by their posterior probabilities</p>
<p>So, the <a href="./Hypothetically-Speaking.html#complexity">Complexities</a> of your Hypotheses have already been incorporated into their posterior probabilities. No need to consider it here. If you have a simple hypothesis that predicts stuff correctly and sharply (say, a causal structure), then it will rule. It will end up having a very high posterior probability and thus dominate your final prediction.</p>
<h1 id="what-makes-a-good-map">What makes a good Map</h1>
<p>Yeah, you would want to have high Prediction Score.</p>
<p>But, informally speaking, how would you know if your current Map is a good one or not?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does it actually <em>constrain</em> your anticipations for those events?</p>
<p>Are you putting more than 100% probability total for all the outcomes? It happens. Turn on the TV and listen to any news channel.</p>
<p>“This party could win the elections tomorrow. But then, that party could win too. And maybe, some other party could win too. And maybe, some coalition could win.”</p>
<p>Next day, when the results arrive, no matter which party wins:</p>
<p>“I told you so! I predicted it! Yay! In your face!”</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>How do you know you are not constraining your anticipation? When you are <em>never wrong</em> (in hindsight)!</p></li>
<li><p>Do you even <em>know</em> what those events are? What the f*ck are you making predictions about?</p>
<p>Are you covering the whole territory or just leaving vast blank spots in your map?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You’re only allowed to say you truly know a subject - aka have a Map that truly reflects the Territory - when you can make accurate predictions about all events that are part of that subject. You have mastered a subject when you have a high Prediction Score there.</p>
<p>For example, getting the right answer on nearly all the questions on your Math exams. Being able to deal with nearly any situation that comes up in your job.</p>

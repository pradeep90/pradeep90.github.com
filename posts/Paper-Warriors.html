<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: How many Hard problems have you tackled in the last few days?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="the-awesomeness-treadmill">The Awesomeness Treadmill</h1>
<p>Yesterday’s topic, “<a href="./What-is-holding-you-back.html">What is holding you back?</a>”, is just a specific instance of a more general problem. It is about avoiding Hard problems. How many truly challenging problems have you tackled lately?</p>
<p>One way to know: How many times have you <em>failed</em>? How many times have you been overpowered by the problem’s complexity?</p>
<p>Why should we take the trouble of facing Hard problems?</p>
<p>If you want to catch fish, you have to go where the fish are. And Hard problems are where the awesomeness is at. That’s not all, though.</p>
<p>You can either move forward or you can slide back. You <em>can’t</em> stand still. You’re either growing Stronger or you’re becoming Weaker.</p>
<p>Look, I’m not saying this is good. I desperately wish for it to be otherwise. But sadly, that’s the way the world works. This is how our brain is designed. You slack off for a while on something and you will be set back by weeks. Your skill will fade, your grasp of the concepts will erode. Time heals all wounds, and also f*cking deletes all understanding.</p>
<p>If you want to get awesome results consistently, you will have to keep taking awesome Action. You cannot sit on your ass. Ever.</p>
<p>He who sleeps weeps.</p>
<h1 id="the-dunning-kruger-effect">The Dunning-Kruger Effect</h1>
<p>What could possibly come in the way of tackling lots of hard problems? You do actually get better with each problem. You can see that. What’s not to like?</p>
<p>What is the strongest force you know of?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Electro-static Force</p></li>
<li><p>Nuclear Force</p></li>
<li><p>The Star Wars Force</p></li>
<li><p>The Force that makes you not want to look foolish</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Who doesn’t want to look confident and in control to other people?</p>
<p>Now, think about the people you know. Who are the people who seem fully confident about everything they do? They can’t even imagine failing. Who are the sort of people who are pretty doubtful about their chances of success? They might say that they aren’t really all that better than others.</p>
<p>Then think of what really happens. In which category do your most successful friends fall? What about the least successful friends?</p>
<p>The people who look most confident are usually those who don’t know how much they suck. The people who actually know their stuff are usually humble. They are aware of how much they are yet to master and rather unaware of how much other people suck. This is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger Effect</a>.</p>
<p>This probably means that there will be a lot of <del>idiots</del> people who will look super-confident to you. Your mind will get convinced that they know everything well. And here you will be, struggling to move forward in your chosen hard problem by even one centimeter. In the irony of ironies, <em>you</em> will look like an idiot and a failure to the other people. And sadly, you will start to look like an idiot and a failure to your own mind as well.</p>
<p>Those hard problems still seem attractive?</p>
<h1 id="paper-warriors">Paper Warriors</h1>
<p>What is the easiest way to become confident about your abilities?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Never test them</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why ex-cricketer commentators are the most confident people on the planet. “His feet are not moving on the crease at all.” “That batsman should learn how to play the short ball better.” “That bowler needs to work on the presentation of the seam.” “He needs to improve his technique.” “Bowlers these days have forgotten the art of swing bowl.” As if they had played perfect matches when they were around. Their averages weren’t any better. Their batting strike rates weren’t any better. Their bowling strike rates weren’t any better.</p>
<p>This is why you are the awesomest person in the world at whatever you did in your childhood (or whatever you did a long time ago). I am the best rifle-shooter, dancer, singer, story-writer, speaker, stuntman, thief, and WWF choke-slam executer in the world. Even though it’s been a decade since I did most of that. How come I’m so awesome now? I’ve become a Paper Warrior. Hey! I can be as awesome as I want. Ain’t no test results to contradict me.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="real-confidence-boss.-real-confidence.">Real Confidence, boss. Real Confidence.</h1>
<p>Conversely, what is the easiest way to make sure you remain grounded all the time?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test the shit out of your abilities</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then allow yourself only as much pride and satisfaction as the results indicate. Don’t compliment yourself for “really trying”. Don’t pat yourself on the back for being a honest, hard-working “rational thinker” when “all these other idiots” are just doing “irrational” stuff.</p>
<p>Remember how I keep saying No Impact, No Right to Talk? This right here is what I mean by Impact. The real-world data. The results of your actions. The fruits of your “insane awesome life-changing” ideas. The test scores.</p>
<p>If you insist on comparing yourself with the “other irrational people”, compare <strong>only</strong> on the test results. Not on the “logical-ness” of your ideas. Not on how “scientific” your thinking is. Not on how many of the “rules” you followed. If you have all this rational thinking shit and they don’t, and if you both still end up getting pretty much the same results, what is the point of all that rational shit? Yup.</p>
<p>What is Real Confidence? How do we know if somebody has the right to feel confident and stuff?</p>
<p>We check if he has been tested regularly or not. Virat Kohli? Yup. He gets tested every single match. Sure, he may fail in some matches. But on most days, he comes out on top and kicks ass. He’s shown himself to be better than most batsman in the world. Cool. He is fully justified in being confident about his abilities. His confidence is rooted in the Impact he is making. Cricket commentators? Nah.</p>
<h1 id="what-we-need">What we need</h1>
<p>What do we all need? We need to get our ass kicked.</p>
<p>What is the surest way to multiply the speed at which you’re improving your skills?</p>
<p>Go out and find out <em>exactly</em> how much you suck.</p>
<p>Refuse to be a Paper Warrior.</p>
<p>Meet the best in the business and get the stuffing knocked out of you. Realize how much you don’t even know yet. <em>That</em> is what we call Intellectual Humility. No Action, No Right to be “<a href="./Regret-without-Action.html">Humble</a>”. Actually figure out how much you need to be humble about and then take action to get rid of it. That is when you can allow yourself to be “humble”.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-actually-make-progress">How to actually make progress</h1>
<p>How do you know whether you’re really Growing Stronger when you’re taking some action? You may end up with a lot of “work”, but that sure ain’t the same as actually improving your life.</p>
<p>Are you feeling slightly <em>uncomfortable</em> while taking action?</p>
<p>Are you a bit <em>nervous</em>?</p>
<p>I was nervous about writing this essay. I felt like putting it off. I wanted to write about something I “understand” (<a href="./What-does-it-mean-to-clarify-an-idea.html">Yo</a>!). It felt like I won’t be able to write “logical points” about this topic or come up with awesome actions for it or something.</p>
<p>We need to give up the old notions of confidence - the idea of looking good to others. The only way to make progress is to Keep it Real - test ourselves like hell. But that will lead to a lot of failed attempts as we’re improving. And thus, nervousness. A bit of anxiety. Discomfort.</p>
<p>What’s wrong with that? Not much directly. A bit of nervousness never killed anyone (I hope). It will keep you sharp on the job. But you will look dumb to others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He doesn’t <del>seem to</del> know what he is doing.”</p>
<p>– Dumb-asses around you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“If we knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research, would it?”</p>
<p>– Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Riddle me this - if you look nervous and unconfident and bullshit and stuff and another person doesn’t, and you kick his ass on the problem consistently, are you really worse than him?</p>
<p>We need to de-link the notions of looking confident and <em>actually</em> succeeding.</p>
<h1 id="which-problem-should-you-take-on">Which problem should you take on?</h1>
<p>Take writing for example. You have lots of choices. You can write about your cat. You can write about something that you think is absolutely “clear” and “obvious” in your own mind. Or you can write about something you’re struggling with.</p>
<p>At each step, we can use this as the heuristic - <strong>Do the Harder Thing</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dude! If you keep doing the harder thing each time, your life will become insanely hard and miserable. Are you a fool?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, yes, I am. But that’s beside the point. The point is we won’t Do the Harder Thing all the time. We will be strategic about it. In every single arena of life except that of the R-word, I will choose to Do the Easier Thing.</p>
<p>Do my laundry every day or do it once a week? Once a week. Walk 30 minutes to the mall or catch the bus? Bus. I’m not a masochist. But write about what is <a href="./What-is-holding-you-back.html">holding you back</a> or about some <a href="./What-is-Approval-Seeking.html">general vague</a> <a href="./Water-Water-Everywhere.html">stuff</a>? Here, I need to choose the harder one every single time.</p>
<p>Why is doing the harder thing good? Because it makes you become Stronger. You know what they say - your mind is like a muscle. Use it or lose it.</p>
<p>And “use it” doesn’t mean use it to decide which Youtube video to watch next or which random Facebook post to read next. Use it the way bodybuilders use their muscles - lift weights that are beyond your current capacity and break down your muscles. They will become bigger and capable of lifting heavier weights next time.</p>
<p>You know that idea you have in your head that is just not clear to you? That one. Or the idea you think you “understand” but are afraid others won’t accept? That one. Or the one that is too big and way too important for you to tackle right now? <strong>That</strong> one. Write about those ideas. Not your cat.</p>
<p>All else being equal, take on the Harder problem.</p>
<h1 id="paying-the-price">Paying the Price</h1>
<p>Ok. So we’ve decided to Do the Harder Thing when it comes to taking on problems. That means we’re gonna keep taking on harder and harder problems instead of just staying in a plateau.</p>
<p>A curious consequence is this: You will <em>never</em> feel fully in control again.</p>
<p>You will forever feel a twinge of nervousness as you approach the problems you’ve chosen. You will have slight (and sometimes, not so slight) doubts about your own ability to conquer the problem.</p>
<p>You know James Bond? He’s always in control of the situation. Nothing ever fazes him. He always looks like he knows what to do. Well, you can say goodbye to that.</p>
<p>You will almost <em>never</em> know for sure what you need to do. You will second-guess most of your decisions. You will always be on the lookout for the one small error that will derail all your hard work. <strong>Constant Vigilance</strong>, in other words.</p>
<h1 id="which-warrior-will-you-be">Which Warrior will you be?</h1>
<p>As you grow Stronger and Stronger, as you gain more experience, you will acquire the ability to face down harder and harder problems. And you will see a lot more of them because you will now have the ability to take them on. Ignorance was Bliss till that point.</p>
<p>Which means that, as you grow older, you will actually find yourself <strong>failing</strong> more and more. You know the dumb newbies who keep getting clean-bowled in cricket? That’s how you’ll be even if you get to Sachin Tendulkar levels of awesomeness. Because the bowlers you play against - the Hard problems - will be stronger and stronger in every next match.</p>
<p>So, that’s goodbye to any dreams of becoming The Wise Old Master, who simply <em>knows</em> the solution to every single problem you present to him.</p>
<p>In other words, there will simply be a lot more failure. You will fall flat on your butt every once in a while. Wise Old Masters don’t like to fall flat on their butts. It’s undignified. Plus, they will lose face in front of all their disciples.</p>
<p>On the bright side, <strong>you</strong> will have tons of more success too. You want awesome results? You need to go solve the hard problems. All the ones that are easy for humans to do have already been done.</p>
<p>It’s a tradeoff. What do you want? Do you want to <em>look</em> successful or do you want to actually <em>be</em> successful? Do you want to be a Paper Warrior, pure and with picture-perfect technique and ultra-super-strong skills - on paper? Or do you want to be a real Warrior, bloody and tired but triumphant?</p>

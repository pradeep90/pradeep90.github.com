<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: Why do we care about writing well? What does it even mean to “write well”? Do we want to win the Nobel Prize in Blog-Writing?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="why-would-you-want-to-write-well">Why would you want to write “well”?</h2>
<p>Isn’t it enough to just write a lot? Won’t that give you all the <a href="./Why-write-Blog-posts.html">benefits</a> of essays?</p>
<p>With 19 posts behind us in The Great 300-Word Experiment, we now want to be a bit more strategic with our essays. What can we do to get the most out of our essay writing?</p>
<p>It’s all very well to say that <a href="./Why-write-Blog-posts.html">writing about ideas</a> clarifies them in your head. It’s cool to say that you will generate lots of ideas when you write. It’s true, too. But it still doesn’t tell you <em>how</em> you should write them. Is it ok if we just mention the name of the problem we’re facing and then expect The Essay-God to come down from blog-heaven to impregnate the solution in our mind like Jeezus? Maybe talk a bit about the weather and about your cat and add in some details about dinner plans?</p>
<h2 id="zoom-in-on-the-problem">Zoom in on the problem</h2>
<p>Let’s look at the problem requirements in greater detail.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Writing about ideas we think we understand clearly</p>
<p>We want to make all the important points explicit and expose any holes in our understanding.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing about ideas we want to understand clearly</p>
<p>We want to discover key points that we had been missing and make the important links in the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Generating ideas</p>
<p>We want to draw analogies and bring out similarities between the current concept and others that we aren’t even thinking about.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Those were the specific requirements. In general, we also want to make sure that we write <em>quickly</em> and efficiently. (Why? What happens if you take hours to write an essay <em>and</em> you’re very busy <em>and</em> you want to write lots of essays? Yup. Nothing.)</p>
<p>There are lots more we would want from our essay writing - creativity [citation needed], ability to convey our idea well, ability to evoke the necessary reactions in the reader, structuring our points for maximum retention and recall, etc. But, hey, this is just v0.2. Lots of good stuff coming up in the future.</p>
<h2 id="a-few-solutions">A Few Solutions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>For ideas we think we understand clearly</p>
<p>It seems like that we need to check if we are making a logical argument that supports our conclusion.</p>
<p>At the end, your essay headings should probably look like</p>
<p>Arguments A and B and C =&gt; Conclusion</p>
<p>You know, like, “Cricket is the best game in the world”, “Bangalore is a cool place to be in”, “I like mangoes” =&gt; “Go Mumbai Indians!!!”</p>
<p>Logical conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>Quick test</strong>: At the end of your essay, see if all the headings alone when put together will logically imply the main point you’re making.</p>
<p>Lots more on this (and other stuff - like giving concrete examples, etc.) coming soon.</p></li>
<li><p>For ideas where we’re just feeling our way around</p>
<p>Here the aim is <em>not</em> to write everything in an orderly, logical fashion. You will kill any creative thought with those handcuffs. What you want is to put forth as many questions as you can about the topic.</p>
<p>The idea isn’t clear in your head. If you haven’t understood it so far, then it probably is a bit of a <a href="./How-to-crack-Hard-problems.html">Hard problem</a>. Perhaps another look at the <a href="./How-to-crack-Hard-problems.html#here-are-some-steps">steps mentioned there</a> will help.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Turn that into a list of specific questions</p>
<p>Need not be complete. This is an ongoing list.</p>
<p>Write down exactly WHY you can’t solve the problem right now.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>For generating new ideas</p>
<p>Have a section at the end of your essay asking “How could this relate to some other areas of my life?”</p>
<p>Like, if you’re writing about how to clarify ideas that aren’t clear, think about how you’ve tried to solve problems in the past. Hey! Hard problems. That strikes a bell.</p>
<p>Keep a running list of topics that you write about. Alternate between them so that you keep trying fresh things everyday.</p>
<p>Lots more on this soon.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-most-important-technique-for-writing-essays-well">The most important technique for writing essays well</h2>
<p>How does a guitar player <a href="./Quantity-over-Quality.html">get better</a> at playing the guitar?</p>
<p>Is it by seeking divine blessings? Or by reading lots of essays online about “How to, umm, play the guitar well (- Part 1)?”</p>
<p>Cool. We know better. All great guitarists spend a lot of time practicing and honing their skills.</p>
<p>But if it takes you 30-40 minutes just to write your 300 words per day, how the heck are you gonna get the experience required to become better? We both know that you would need to write lots of essays to absorb the essence of the skill and stuff. That’s <a href="./The-Great-300-Word-Experiment.html">why</a> we’re writing one everyday. But 300 words is the bare minimum entry ticket price. With it, you can go to the Cups and Saucers ride, then the kids Ship ride, and a couple of other rides that will make your grandmother yawn. Oh, and maybe you can play Dodgem cars for 2 minutes. And after that, you will need to stand back and watch everybody else enjoy the insanely exciting roller-coasters and f*cking turn-you-upside-down thriller rides. Unlimited times. Cos they bought the premium adults ticket.</p>
<p>300 words is the life-jacket you have, to save your awesome unbroken daily essay streak when life hits your ship with an iceberg. <em>That’s</em> when you write about your cat and your dinner for today. But if you want to level up, and fast, you need to write a lot more. A lot lot more.</p>
<p>How do you speed it up?</p>
<p>You need to learn how to f*cking <strong>type</strong>! Type real fast. Without looking at the keys.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SPK has finally gone nuts. I knew something was wrong with him after that weird <a href="./Portrait-of-the-Writer-as-an-Ignorant-Fool.html">Portrait</a> post. He’s finally cracked.</p>

<p>Thalaivar Steve Yegge wrote a post about <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.kr/2008/09/programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html">“Programming’s Dirtiest Little Secret”</a>. It is also Writing’s Dirtiest Little Secret. Yup. You got it.</p>
<p>How are some people writing more than a 100,000 words in a month without even breaking a sweat?</p>
<p>Here’s the secret. They type <strong>real</strong> fast!</p>
<h2 id="the-weakest-link">The Weakest Link</h2>
<p>What happens when you type fast without looking at the keys? Could it be that your ideas get transmitted to the screen without any sort of intermediate delay? Could it be useful to a writer to be able to type out stuff just as fast as he is thinking? Without any sort of gap? Thoughts -&gt; Words, instantly. Would it be useful to put all your thoughts out on paper in full flow, rapidly following any trains of thought that come up along the way, noting it all down in full glory? And then edit them after a while, cleaning up stuff, and leaving them sparkling crystal clear?</p>
<p>What would that do for you?</p>
<p>Raise your hand if you’re still thinking touch-typing is a complete waste of time, meant only for secretaries who have nothing better to do.</p>
<p>What wouldn’t you give to be able to put down all the thoughts in your mind out on paper, explicit, right in front of your eyes, where they can’t hide among all the other bastards in your head?</p>
<p>F*ck!!! I want that! F*ck you, reader. I don’t care whether you want that or not. Damn it! I sold myself on this idea!!! :*</p>
<p>For the last couple of paragraphs, I started paying attention to how I was typing… Suddenly, I picked up my speed. I started typing my thoughts without <em>any</em> sort of editing or finger-bureaucratic delays. Just pure flow of thought out there on my Emacs screen. Motherf*cker, that felt good!</p>
<p>I want this. Or, to be precise, I want more of this.</p>
<p>I already type at 100wpm at will. So, does that mean I finish 300-word posts in 3 minutes? F*ck no!</p>
<p>Nobody composes stuff at that speed. The max speeds I have heard of among highly prolific online writers (like those on NaNoWriMo) are around 2400 words per hour. And that’s for fiction, where you have full license to pour your thoughts out there without two f*cks for grammar or style in the first draft.</p>
<p>This is non-fiction. Essay-writing. But still, we can go up around 1000-2000 words easy on the first draft, even as we are clarifying and generating and whatnot.</p>
<p>Most of the time you spend “writing” your essay is actually time spent “thinking”. Just like in T20 cricket, where you’ll probably only run in and bowl the ball for a few seconds for each delivery. The whole rest of the time is spent in setting the field, discussing strategy with your captain, cussing at the batsman, and rubbing your ball on your arse. Just like essay writing.</p>
<p>You will be pretty much stationary when doing all that between deliveries. But when you decide to run in to the batsman as a fast bowler, you need to run in like Death Himself and knock the f*ck out of the batsman’s ass (aka the problem you’re tackling). Ditto for essays. When the f*cking ideas start flowing, your fingers need to be ready to start typing at full speed. You need to catch as many of those ideas as possible. Else, they’ll just slip right past you. In the chain of ideas (when they come) from your mind to your website, your fingers are the weakest link.</p>
<h2 id="where-what-how-long">Where? What? How long?</h2>
<p>Only one place on Earth you need to go.</p>
<p><a href="http://play.typeracer.com/">Typeracer</a></p>
<p>Race against your friends and others over the web.</p>
<p>5 minutes a day should be more than enough. In a month or so, you will have pretty much doubled your speed. Or your money back (Yo! It’s free!).</p>
<p>And for those of you who think they won’t have the time or motivation to spend 5 minutes on “boring typing practice”, here’s some news.</p>
<p>I can’t access Typeracer on my computer. Why not? Cos I’ve blocked that website.</p>
<p>Why?! Cos it is so f*cking damn addictive. Forget any notions of ancient “typing tutorial” Windows applications you might have seen in the past. Oh, you try to stop yourself playing this one. Good Luck! Have fun!</p>
<p>Remember, Action rocks!</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>PS</strong>: Oh, and by the way, what is my <a href="./The-Double-Edged-Sword-of-Essays.html#checklist-for-writing-safely">Keep it Real</a> test for these ideas?</p>
<p>When writing essays, I’m gonna type for 20 minutes non-stop without editing myself for the next one week. That should force me to take Action on the idea of letting your thoughts flow out as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Plus, I’m keeping track of the time taken to write each post (along with the word count).</p>
<p>And for the other ideas? Coming soon.</p>

<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: Grow. But how?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="planting-the-seed">Planting the seed</h2>
<p>The last time we were on the High Road, we spoke about the dangers of pressing the Revenge button when someone has wronged you. Your mind becomes consumed by the fire of revenge. And that displaces the <a href="http://paulgraham.com/top.html">Top Idea in your Mind</a>. And that effectively blows away any chances of having awesome epiphanies and stuff.</p>
<p>Cool. That basically told us why we should think twice before pressing the Revenge button. But how exactly do we Grow? Just grit our teeth and let others kick us in the balls?</p>
<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>What will it feel like when you are in a classic “Revenge or Grow” situation?</p>
<p>First of all, every single fiber in your body will be shouting for you to press the Revenge button. Your mind will give you a hundred reasons why you should shoot the motherf*cker who has hurt you.</p>
<p>It will feel like you’re making a big mistake by pressing Grow. It will feel like the other person is going to just make your life hell if you let them get away with it.</p>
<p>“C’mon… you should at least do something, man… Otherwise, they will keep pulling the same crap again and again…” - The Revenge Mind, yesterday.</p>
<h2 id="what-it-means-to-take-the-high-road">What it means to take the High Road</h2>
<p>Think of someone you know who is <em>above</em> all this crap.</p>
<p>Someone who is just plain unaffected by such bullshit. Someone who refuses to get involved in any sort of vengeful behaviour and who doesn’t get ruffled even when others try to press <em>his</em> buttons.</p>
<p><strong>That</strong> is my vision for Revenge or Grow.</p>
<p>Who do I seek inspiration from?</p>
<p>I have this friend called H****h (let’s call him Heh for short). So Heh is this ultra-chill guy who is <em>always</em> having fun, no exceptions.</p>
<p>I have rarely ever seen him get down to the level of trying to hurt somebody because they hurt him or to take out his anger on someone because they were unbelievably late or failed to keep their word. Or because they disrespected him and treated him like low-status crap.</p>
<p>Is he mad? How can he keep this up? Won’t he just get crushed under all the crap others will pull on him? It’s like a business that manufactures at a cost of Rs 200 and hands it out at Rs 100. Won’t they just go bust sooner or later?</p>
<p>What does he do? Does he bitch about it on his blog (like yours truly)? Does he perhaps take his anger out on his family or girlfriend?</p>
<p>Now, I told you about two buttons - Revenge or Grow. The point is, when they are in front of him, the buttons look like this - Revenge or Have Insane Fun. Which one do you think he picks?</p>
<h2 id="revenge-or-have-insane-fun">Revenge or Have Insane Fun</h2>
<p>No matter what happens (within limits), he chooses to lighten up the mood and talk about the latest songs he’s excited about or the movies he wants to see or about some developments about girls and stuff.</p>
<p>It’s like this. Consider two people in identical irritating situations - one of them is Heh and the other is a normal person Mr. TP (Tension Party / Thev. Pai.). Mr. TP chooses to become angry, frustrated, and then take Revenge, and then lose peace of mind, then bitch about it for the rest of the day, and dream about a hundred ways of torturing the bastard who hurt him.</p>
<p>As for Thalaivar Heh… well… Heh takes this opportunity to kick it up one more notch. Have <em>more</em> fun. Live a <em>more</em> awesome life. Go meet some more friends.</p>
<p>What happens?</p>
<p>First, he loses <strong>nothing</strong>. It is all in the positive. He has not wasted time in the moment taking Revenge and possibly having it backfire on him. Nor has he allowed it to eat the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Second, next to him - Holy Crap - the other guy looks like such a dumb-ass! How can you possibly have succeeded in your goal of putting the other person down when the motherf*cker is having the time of his life?</p>
<h2 id="the-big-picture">The Big Picture</h2>
<p>What sort of person don’t people mess with? We might think of some ultra-strong, extra-perfect, super-high-status guy (with a 11-inch ding dong) who everyone is scared of. No one wants to mess with him. Bullcrap. Such people don’t exist. More on that later.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you who people don’t mess with. Heh. It’s like he’s got Captain America’s shield or something. You just know it’s pointless to try to hurt him. It just bounces back. He just keeps on keeping on being happy! All those petty rivalries and status battles and currents of hatred that run among people… ain’t none of that bullshit around Heh.</p>
<p>If you’re worried about the long-term consequences and about whether you will lose your social status because of all the non-Revenging or whether people will think you’re some kind of pussy… let me tell you. Ain’t nobody I know who is more loved and more popular than Heh.</p>
<p>People want to be around him all the time. Why? Cos he is like a nuclear power plant of Joy and Excitement. Got enough for himself and for the next 10 villages.</p>
<p><strong>That</strong> is what I’m talking about.</p>

<h2 id="ps">PS</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Initial ideas</p>
<p>Can’t see the truth clearly when in Revenge mode. (Will write about this next time :P Went off and discovered different ideas)</p>
<p>Goal: Become like H****h.</p></li>
<li><p>Final ideas</p>
<p>What to expect when your mind is in Revenge Mode.</p>
<p>Revenge or Have Insane Fun.</p>
<p>No loss at all. All positive.</p>
<p>Other guy - dumb-ass.</p>
<p>Long term feasibility proof.</p></li>

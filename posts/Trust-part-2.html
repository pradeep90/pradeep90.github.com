<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: Why am I talking about trust and crap? Shouldn’t I be talking about logic and thinking and action and whatnot? What’s the big deal with trust and <em>emotions</em> and stuff?</p>
<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>When I last wrote about my good friend, CTW (who is <em>not</em> Mr. Special Agent), I mentioned the idea of a Mastermind group. I spoke about how we used to help each other on our paths towards Rationality. (What does that mean, btw? More coming soon.)</p>
<p>It was all going great two years ago. Where did it turn south?</p>
<h2 id="frustration">Frustration</h2>
<p>Unresponsive. Disinterested. Snide. Rude.</p>
<p>These were some of the adjectives I used last time.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>We once used to have trouble fitting in all the awesome stuff we wanted to talk about in the short span of two hours. Now, it was a mere courtesy meeting, like the formal proceedings that take place at the President’s office or at the Queen’s palace. Stuff for the sake of doing it. Not for any strong purpose.</p>
<p>Most importantly, from my point of view, he pretty much stopped taking any sort of action in the areas that both of us cared about.</p>
<p>Even when I would put forth some ideas and suggestions, his involvement would be minimal. He started pretty much saying no to just about anything new I brought up. It was almost like he was becoming close-minded for some reason.</p>
<p>And that shocked me because, in my oh-so-humble opinion, he is one of the most open-minded people I know. And I know a <em>lot</em> of people - smart computer geeks, smart MBA-types, smart math types, cool jockeys, fun jolly-go-lucky guys, and everything in between. More on that later.</p>
<h2 id="take-it-easy-urvasi">Take it easy, Urvasi?</h2>
<p>Cool. So, I was frustrated with him.</p>
<p>And we had naturally drifted apart, cos of work and whatnot. Week in, week out, he used to be “busy” with stuff. And though I’ve never really ever been busy in my life, I did have other stuff to focus on. And this part of my life, though once a source of great joy and motivation, was now giving me nothing but frustration and negativity.</p>
<p>Why get worked up about it, then? Just move on and be done with it.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>A historical example</strong>: Till around the middle of the nineteenth century, Japan was pretty much closed to the world economy. No imports, no exports, nothing.</p>
<p>In 1854, the US had to send its navy over to Japan to <em>force</em> it to accept Western trade. It had to persuade the Japanese government to trade with it. Tl</p>
<p>Trade can make everyone better off (more Economics coming later). Trade made the US better off. More importantly, trade made Japan better off. Way better off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although Japan opened its ports to modern trade only reluctantly, once it did, it took advantage of the new access to modern technological developments. Japan’s opening to the West enabled it to modernize its military, and to rise quickly to the position of the most formidable Asian power in the Pacific</p>
<p>– https://history.state.gov/milestones/1830-1860/opening-to-japan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why the f*ck did the US have to <em>force</em> Japan to do something that was <em>awesome</em> for it?</p>
<p>Just to put that in perspective, Japan is right now world #3 in terms of nominal GDP right now. Can you even see Japan in a map of the globe?</p>
<hr />
<p>I knew close partnership and working together with CTW would be good for me. My life would be better off for it. That was clear as day to me.</p>
<p>I also knew that working with me and growing together would be great for CTW. He would be better off too.</p>
<p>And yet, for some reason, he was holding back like hell. I hadn’t heard anything from him in the last six months and he had declined to meet me the last two times I tried.</p>
<p>Ok. There’s only so much you can do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have no power to make other men see the truth.</p>
<p>– Albus Dumbledore, Prisoner of Azkaban</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="hope-and-fear">Hope and Fear</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Hope, it is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness.</p>
<p>– The Architect, Matrix Reloaded</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, he pings me out of the blue asking to chat on the weekend.</p>
<p>My hope was that he would have changed and that we could blast off.</p>
<p>My fear was that he would still be as closed and resistant as the last time.</p>
<p>We hadn’t spoken in a while, so I had thought this was pretty much over. I had moved on. Plus, because he hadn’t kept up his commitments, I was not willing to invest even a bit of my time and energy in this until he showed that he was willing to take hard action this time.</p>
<p>I fully expected to have a completely non-committal chat with him, where he wouldn’t really commit to any action or contribute directly.</p>
<p>I had decided to confront him directly and tell him openly (we’re aspiring to rationality, after all) that I wasn’t willing to spend my time unless he provided some visible value to me.</p>
<hr />
<p>In other words, I didn’t trust him at all.</p>
<p>I believed that he had been making all kinds of excuses over the last six months saying that he was “busy” and stuff.</p>
<p>I believed that he had become more close-minded and that he was more interested in pointing out my flaws than in taking constructive action.</p>
<p>No trust at all.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, what happened? Did I confront him?</p>
<p>What happened to my trust?</p>
<p>(to be continued)</p>

<p>How many <em>ideas</em> do you have? How many awesome essay ideas do you have in mind for your blog (you do <a href="./Why-write-Blog-posts.html">have one</a>, don’t you)?</p>
<p>What happens to them? Have you written about even half of them? Maybe 20%? 1%? What is the point of having all these “ideas” if you aren’t even clarifying them (by writing essays), let alone taking action on them?</p>
<p>I have this file called “Website-Notes.org”. It’s grown from holding simple ideas for three drafts in the first week to a 650-line monster now. Yeah, there’s a lot of ideas in there. So, why haven’t I written about them?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>F*ck!</strong> I just realized I had answered this exact question ten days ago in “<a href="./What-is-holding-you-back.html">What is holding you back?</a>”, shooting down all the lame-ass excuses my mind was coming up with. I had completely forgotten about that essay. Damn the <a href="./Why-write-Blog-posts.html#leaky-buckets">Leaky Bucket</a>! Need to do something to make sure I don’t lose track of the ideas I have already figured out. I have a great idea for doing this, but… Yo!!!</p>
<p>Hmmm… Ok. Quick review -</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What have I got to lose by writing out a crap version 1 of my idea?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>How many people are gonna read this?</p>
<p>Almost none.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it ok to lose the initial readers with my poor explanations so that I can refine my understanding and explain it better to future readers?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p></li>
<li><p>Moral of the story</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to write about your most important ideas.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok. Got it. Memory refreshed.</p>
<h1 id="can-vs-must">Can vs Must</h1>
<p>Cool. What that essay says is basically that you <em>can</em> start writing about important ideas right now. There is no need to fear at all. Nothing bad will happen. Only good things will come out of it (you’ll understand the idea better and generate more ideas).</p>
<p>That’s a burden off my shoulder. In fact, if you remember, that is how the <a href="./Akrasia.html">Will Power</a> sequence got started. I decided that I had had enough of waiting and just went ahead with something that was important to me.</p>
<p>So far so good. But the story doesn’t end there. It says I <em>can</em> write about important stuff, but it doesn’t say I <em>must</em>. There’s no urgency.</p>
<p>What’s wrong with having a whole notes file full of ideas for future essays?</p>
<p>I would probably take each idea and write about it when the time comes, right?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Why do I say that? Think back to your personal experience? How many times have you ever taken action on a plan set by you three months ago? Six months ago? A year ago?</p>
<p>I’m willing to wager that you’ve probably never done it. I can’t remember a single instance when I have.</p>
<p>What happened? Life happened.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="expiry-date">Expiry date</h1>
<p>If you have more than 30 ideas for essays holed up in your notes file</p>
<p><strong>and</strong> you write one essay per day</p>
<p><strong>and</strong> on many days you want to write about something that you’re <a href="./Revenge-or-Grow.html">feeling</a> <a href="./Why-take-the-high-road.html">strongly</a> <a href="./Road-to-the-High-Road.html">about</a> <a href="./Drama-kills-the-Dog-and-your-Dreams.html">on that particular day</a></p>
<p><strong>and</strong> you usually generate more ideas for essays with every single essay you write…</p>
<p>What is the probability that you will have written about these current 30+ ideas in 30 days’ time?</p>
<p>Basically, when you see them 30 days from now, they will be outdated plans that some idiot (i.e., you from the past) had set for you. You’ll toss them aside. And this is after one month. Imagine what will happen when you see them one f*cking year from now!</p>
<p>Holy crap! I have notes files on my computer that have been lying around for motherf*cking years now! What have I done about the ideas in them? Yup. Zilch.</p>
<p>Worse, they will just keep adding pressure on you and make you feel bad and <a href="./Fie-on-your-TODO-List.html">deplete your W-Power</a>.</p>
<p>What is the solution, then? Just delete your notes file right now? Hmmm… that would be an ok solution.</p>
<p>Can we do any better?</p>
<p>(to be continued)</p>

<h1 id="ps">PS</h1>
<p>It’s hard to describe the twists and turns I went through in terms of idea-generation as I was writing this essay.</p>
<p>I started off with something completely different (ok, only slightly different) and wrote a bunch of paragraphs that started off a new train of thought. I cut them off and decided to write about them separately tomorrow. I was gonna publish the remaining part directly, but decided to add a proper ending for the last section. And that led me to the 30 days vs 100 ideas and more problem and reminded me of how many notes files are lying around unused on my computer.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I realize this isn’t just about the backlog on the essay ideas for my website. This is about the backlog on the ideas for my entire life. Holy Crap! Now, I <em>badly</em> want this problem to be solved!</p>
<p>Why am I writing a PS after every essay? To convince future-SPK (and any readers) of how powerful essay-writing can be for generating ideas. Next time I’m procrastinating on writing an essay by saying that I don’t have a clear idea or that I’m not in the “writing flow” or whatever, I can show myself this.</p>
<h1 id="open-letter-to-future-spk">Open letter to future-SPK</h1>
<p>Yo!! Today I was watching two back-to-back IPL matches and didn’t even want to spend any time writing an essay. And yet I took a couple of minutes to put together something. My mind wasn’t in it. I kept getting distracted. I wanted to do anything but write.</p>
<p>Then I wrote one paragraph. One little idea trickled through into my consciousness. Then, I realized that I had already f*cking solved this problem in another essay. I went and read it up. And that made me think about what was different about the current problem I was talking about. And that just broke the dam and gave me so many ideas that I seriously contemplated not publishing it today and doing justice to it in complete detail tomorrow.</p>
<p>That’s what you get if you invest a solid ten minutes into essay writing, <del>bitch</del> SPK. Trust the process. No matter how sucky you feel when you begin, you will get into the zone sooner or later. It may take 200 words, or maybe 600 words. But you will get there. And at that point, there would be <strong>nothing</strong> in the world you would rather be doing than writing that essay and generating tons of valuable ideas. That is why we write every single day, without fail. We want to get into the <em>habit</em> of generating awesome ideas every motherf*cking day.</p>
<p>You’ve written 49,178 words in 42 essays in 42 days so far. The ideas in them may not have been earth-shattering ones so far, but nearly each and every one of them has come to you <strong><em>in the process of writing</em></strong> the essay.</p>
<p>In fact, even this idea (that each idea has come in the process of writing the essay) came to me five seconds ago as I was struggling to conclude this Open Letter section properly.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about coming in with a basketful of ideas or a terrific writing mood.</p>
<p>Write and they will come.</p>

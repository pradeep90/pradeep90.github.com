            <h1>Regret without Action</h1>

            <h2 id="a-tale-of-two-students">A tale of two students</h2>
<p>Math student A (10 minutes before exam gets over): “I don’t know Integral Calculus too well. I didn’t study. I can’t be fully sure. I could have made a mistake anywhere.”</p>
<p>And then, he sits there twiddling his pen till the bell rings.</p>
<p>Math student B (10 minutes before exam gets over): “I don’t know Integral Calculus too well. I didn’t study. I can’t be fully sure. I could have made a mistake anywhere. Let me go through the paper and double-check my answers. Let me see if I can get some answers I didn’t get earlier.”</p>
<p>What is the difference between Math student A and Math student B? They both feel EXACTLY the same way about their level of preparation, the way they have written the answers, how many answers they expect to get right.</p>
<p>What is the difference?</p>
<h1 id="frustration-and-compassion">Frustration and Compassion</h1>
<p>I’m writing this essay after being fed up with all the people who tell me over and over that what I’m saying makes absolute sense - that they were making a mistake and that they should change… and then they do absolutely diddly squat about it. <em>Including</em> the guy who’s writing this post right now. No more.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess you’re right, da. I agree with you. I guess I should probably do <em>[insert important valuable action here]</em>. But, I don’t really <em>[insert arbitrary excuse here]</em>.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Manippu - Tamizhla enakku pudikkaadha orey vaarthai!” - Captain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. I’m not like Captain. I don’t hate the word ‘sorry’. I don’t even hate people who say sorry.</p>
<p>Look, I understand. You screwed up. We all do. I screw up at least 22 times a day. I swear. I should know what it feels like.</p>
<p>I understand. I don’t hate you cos you failed to take action on something you know you should. I wouldn’t know the meaning of being human if I beat you up for it. Shit happens.</p>
<p>BUT, if you don’t take ANY action on it, that statement is WORTHLESS. And I will hate on you for it. Ditto for myself. If I admit that I screwed up and do nothing about it, I feel disgusted at myself.</p>
<p>Yes, by all means, admit that you screwed up. It happens to everyone. Have some self-compassion (more on that key topic soon).</p>
<p>BUT, look to take action to get better. (also see - <a href="http://road-to-rationality.blogspot.com/2012/01/economics-of-spilt-milk.html">Sunk Costs</a>)</p>
<h1 id="tough-talk">Tough Talk</h1>
<p>I’m gonna go out on a limb here.</p>
<ul>
<li>“I am so lazy, da. I know I should be doing it but I don’t.”</li>
<li>“Yeah, I know I should probably read up on that stuff, but I just don’t feel like it.”</li>
<li>“Yeah, machan. I know I should quit smoking. I mean, I really want to. I’ve been trying for a while now.” (all this said while he’s blowing smoke into the air right in front of me outside a tea stall.&quot;</li>
<li>“Yeah, da. You’re probably right about all this research on happiness. It sounds very interesting. Hmmm… anyway, so, you know, last week I went to this awesome restaurant…”</li>
<li>“Hmmm… yeah, what you’re saying seems right. Maybe it is just not acceptable for us to live so large while so many suffer in poverty. Hmmm…. anyway, so, you know, last night I saw this awesome movie…”</li>
</ul>
<p>And just so you know I’m not only picking on others -</p>
<ul>
<li>“Yeah, I know, I should write more. Yeah… yeah… I know, lots more. I should write a post like every day. Hmmm… anyway, so, you know, last night I listened to this awesome song…”</li>
<li>“Yeah, I know, I should be going to bed early every night and making it a f#@king habit of waking up like at f#@king 7am in the morning. Hmmm… anyway, so, you know, last night…”</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="constant-vigilance">Constant Vigilance</h1>
<p>Hear me now - I do not concede your right to say those things. You have no right to say any of those things. You don’t get to enjoy all the benefits of admitting to your flaws and showing yourself to be humble and stuff. (What benefits could there be? Rhetorical)</p>
<p>… unless - unless you take some action to back it up. Otherwise, it is just an empty statement.</p>
<p>Regret without Action is utterly useless. Humility without Action is worse than useless.</p>
<p>I don’t care what you do. Even if it is just a small measure, do it. If it a baby step like committing to write 300 words a day every motherf#@king single day, cool. I will respect the f#@k out of you for that. Because you would be exactly 3756 times better than that *!$#% who just sits there, says stuff, and then still sits there.</p>
<p>We will sit there, say stuff, and then run and take action like our ass is on fire.</p>
<p>Who will you be - Math student A or Math student B?</p>
<p>[PS: This is a post written out of a teensy weensy bit of anger. I’m sure it didn’t show. But yeah, I should probably write it in a more soothing manner so that people will actually change after reading it. Yeah, I guess you’re right. Hmmm… anyway, you know, last night I saw this awesome episode…]</p>

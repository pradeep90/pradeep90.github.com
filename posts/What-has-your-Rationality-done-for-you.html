<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: Seriously. What has it done for you?</p>
<hr />
<p>Note: In this post, “you” refers to SPK. You can also make it refer to you if you want.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-do-we-do-with-ideas">What do we do with Ideas?</h2>
<p>What are we even “generating ideas” about anyway?</p>
<p>We keep talking proudly about how awesome “Rationality” is or how awesome Logical Thinking is or how awesome Science is. But what has it done for you?</p>
<p>It deconverted you from religion? Cool. Now what?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey! Lots of major wars and stuff in the world and lots of suffering is caused because of Religious beliefs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dude! First of all, <em>you</em> (a pretty reasonable, open-minded upper middle class person) were never part of all those things.</p>
<p>Second, do you think that if, with one magical wish, all of religion were wiped out of this world, all these problems would vanish?</p>
<p>Which came first - human nature or religion?</p>
<p>You’re saying it was religion that made humans do all that crap stuff. Which is true. But you’re also saying that, without religion, humans wouldn’t do all that crap stuff. Which is so not true.</p>
<p>Most important of all, none of the arguments that moved you will have any effect on the people who really cause all the suffering and stuff based on religion. It is a near-unfalsifiable belief in their head. Trust me. I should know.</p>
<p>Which means all that Logical Thinking and Rationality that deconverted you is basically of no use against all the people who are strong believers (with a few exceptions).</p>
<p>Which means you can’t praise Rationality to the skies saying that it will deliver mankind from Religion. It won’t. At least not in its current form.</p>
<p><a href="./Who-should-you-respect.html">No Impact, No Right to Talk</a>.</p>
<p>If your Rationality is so great, go forth and make it happen. Change all those minds. End all the pain and suffering. And then come back. I will join you in your praise. Until then, no <a href="./Who-should-you-respect.html">respect</a> whatsoever.</p>
<p>What else has Rationality done for you?</p>
<h2 id="the-crux-of-it-all">The crux of it all</h2>
<p>It all comes down to this - How much has “Rationality” really raised the Quality of your Life?</p>
<p>Don’t fall for the rationalizations. Keep your eyes fixed on the Impact.</p>
<p>How is your life <em>different</em> from that of a person who doesn’t have the awesome, elite-level, super-duper-scientific, Insane Awesome Rational ideas that you have?</p>
<p>In fact, how is your life different from the life <em>you</em> led a few months or years ago, before you had the above awesome, elite-level, super-duper-scientific, Insane Awesome Rational ideas?</p>
<p>Don’t hide behind the “<a href="./Who-should-you-respect.html#potential-argument">potential to change in the future</a>” shield. Not allowed.</p>
<p>And don’t say it’s coming in the future cos you’ve had very little time so far. Well, you’ve had a few months or years, right? If your ideas really are awesome, elite-level, super-duper-scientific, then you should have got at least a taste of the corresponding results.</p>
<p>If not, then you need to Shut the F*ck Up and stop trying to shove your awesome, elite-level, Insane Awesome Rational ideas down other people’s throats as if they were the cure for every problem they have ever had.</p>
<p>Your ideas are not that awesome (yet). Accept it. Suck it up.</p>
<p>Stop trying to sell it to other people. Stop acting all superior just because you possess these insane awesome ideas and these other poor lost people don’t. Those ideas don’t matter. Your life is gonna turn out pretty much the same way. Get off your f*cking high horse, SPK, and walk in the mud like the rest of the people. When you can show me the Impact of your ideas, then you can soar off high in the sky atop your falcon. Until then, trudge through mud and take action like the other mortals.</p>
<h2 id="ps">PS</h2>
<p>Struggled like hell while writing this post. It was actually about another topic that swerved and swerved and turned into this.</p>
<p>More about actions and real Impact in the next post.</p>

            <h1 id="writers-block">Writer’s Block?</h1>
<p>Everybody with half a brain knows they should write. They <strong>want</strong> to write.</p>
<p>Wisdom from the Thalaivar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is certainly the most important thing I’ll ever say in my blogs: YOU should write blogs.</p>
<p>Even if nobody reads them, you should write them. It’s become pretty clear to me that blogging is a source of both innovation and clarity. I have many of my best ideas and insights while blogging. Struggling to express things that you’re thinking or feeling helps you understand them better.</p>
<p>– Steve Yegge, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs">You should write blogs</a></p>

<p>Why don’t we write more?</p>
<h1 id="remedies">Remedies</h1>
<p>What could you do to fix this?</p>
<p>Perhaps, send over Rs 500 to your friend and ask him to burn it if you don’t publish 2 posts by the end of the week?</p>
<p>Sounds crazy? Why not?</p>
<h1 id="problems-with-the-normal-approach">Problems with the normal approach</h1>
<p>You’re demanding too much of yourself.</p>
<p>We need to go a bit easy on ourselves.</p>
<p>We <strong>want</strong> to write, but are being distracted by other, easier stuff that’s more enjoyable.</p>
<p>If you put too much of an ask on yourself, you’re gonna fail inevitably. And then, you’re gonna beat yourself up about it.</p>
<p>And then, just to make up for all the times you’ve f*cked up, you’re gonna ask even more of yourself.</p>
<p>(Can you see where this is going? Sound familiar?)</p>
<p>Does that mean we give up?</p>
<p>We NEVER give up (unless it’s impossible, in which case we give up as soon as possible).</p>
<h1 id="the-nanowrimo-solution">The NaNoWriMo solution</h1>
<p>For the clueless, NaNoWriMo is National Novel Writing Month. Come November, people sharpen their pencils and oil their keyboards to get going towards their target - 50,000 words in 30 days.</p>
<p>Why would anybody do that? Don’t they know that writing novels takes about three and a half years and that you only attempt to do so if you have a lifetime’s worth of interesting experiences and an inexplicable divine gift and/or an idea about a magic school (Love you, JKR!)?</p>
<p>Many of them get it done, though. In spades. I’ve heard of novels being written of the order of hundreds of thousands of words (that’s like 2-3 mainstream-size novels, in 30 days).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The project started in July 1999 with just 21 participants, but by the 2010 event over 200,000 people took part - writing a total of over 2.8 billion words.</p>

<p>Cool. I’m convinced. What’s their secret?</p>
<p>There’s a lot of reasons to their success, but the one that comes straight to mind is this - <strong>Focus on Quantity over Quality</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Q: Why would that work?</p>
<p>Q: What can we do with that? We aren’t writing novels or anything.</p>
<p>Q: Hey, I don’t even know what I’m doing here. I don’t want to write. Writing is for losers. I just want to watch the next movie. Leave me alone.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Step 1: Start a blog</p>
<p>Doesn’t have to be anything fancy. You could go Blogspot. Or Wordpress. Or you could go <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll">Hakyll</a>!</p></li>
<li><p>Step 2: <em>Write 300 words</em>. <strong>Everyday</strong>.</p>
<p>End of story.</p></li>
<li><p>Step 3: Write a post gloating about your new idea for getting over Writer’s Block</p>
<p>Heh.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t have to write a complete post every day. Who says you have to put out complete, packaged posts with a ribbon on them?</p>
<p>Write 300 words in any order you want. Throw a few words at the beginning. A couple at the end. Maybe a dozen words in a paragraph here, a baker’s dozen in a paragraph there. A quote or two from your favourite authors and hey! You’re done for the day!</p>
<p>You can then go back to your village and say proudly, “Naanum oru Writer, da!”</p>
<p>Feel free to come back some other time and add some more words, maybe cleaning up a few of your earlier sentences. Throw in a snappy introduction and a good conclusion and you have a complete post.</p>
<p>Doesn’t it sound ridiculously easy?</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s the answer to my question earlier. Why might this work so effectively?</p>

<p>When Quantity comes, can Quality be far behind?</p>

<p>And remember, there’s no pressure. You don’t even have to complete your</p>

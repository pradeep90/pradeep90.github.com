<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: How many changes should you make at the same time?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="slaying-the-mythical-master-of-discipline">Slaying the Mythical Master of Discipline</h1>
<p>In “<a href="./How-much-Will-Power-do-you-have.html">How much Will Power do you have?</a>” yesterday, we saw that your Will Power is a finite resource.</p>
<p>Not only that, it is a shared global resource. Which means you draw from the same tank of Will Power no matter what you’re doing. Controlling yourself from eating cookies will make you suck at a perseverance test later. They needn’t have any connection with each other. Use it for one and have less for the other.</p>
<p>What does this tell you about all those ultra-disciplined-max people who seem to do one tough task after another without even <em>thinking</em> about taking a break? What about those people who can make themselves sit and study for the entire day at full concentration, no matter what? What about those artists and musicians who just create stuff non-stop without any effort?</p>
<p>They all have one thing in common - they don’t exist. It is humanly impossible to do any of that crap. But what about that guy you heard of? That one guy who used to study day and night and refuse food and water (ok, I’m exaggerating a bit here)? Or that employee who just worked hour after hour without tiring or wanting to go and do some fun stuff?</p>
<p>They have a term for this kind of thing - urban myth. Don’t fall for that crap.</p>
<h1 id="when-your-reach-exceeds-your-grasp">When your reach exceeds your grasp</h1>
<p>Cool. Now, before we proceed with other insights about Will Power, let’s try to make sure we’re utilizing this Will Power Depletion insight for maximum Impact. What mistaken notions were we carrying around in our minds?</p>
<p>One was about the Mythical Master of <del>Mental Masturbation</del> “Discipline”. No more. Nobody can go on making tough anti-impulsive decisions without collapsing at the end of it.</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>You know those New Year’s Resolutions we make? Or any kind of resolutions - “I’m gonna study harder this semester”, “I’m gonna become fitter”, “I’m gonna write an essay every day”. What do they usually look like?</p>
<p>Take “becoming fitter” for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m going to lift weights every alternate day (or every day if you want to make a radical change). Then, I’m going to do cardio every single day. (Sound familiar?) Then I’m going to eat high-protein food and reduce high-fat and high-carb foods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You now know that doing things against your impulse depletes your Will Power. Tell me what will happen to the guy making the above plan for becoming fitter.</p>
<p>In one month’s time, is he more likely to be sticking to the plan or not? Why? What doomed him?</p>
<h1 id="the-burden-of-change">The Burden of Change</h1>
<p>Every single discipline-requiring action that you add on to your life makes it that much more likely that you’re gonna fail. And so it is said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you try to make ten new changes at the same time, you will fail at all fifteen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more you demand from your poor little finite daily Will Power bank account, the less and less there will be left for the other tasks. Which means that even your existing tasks will get affected. So, not only will you probably fail at the new tasks, you’ll fail at some old ones too.</p>
<p>This seems to suggest that we should make few and judicious demands of our Will Power. We should conserve it for important tasks the way a prudent family conserves fuel. They take out their car only when they’re going some distance. When they have to go to the grocery store, they just walk. Use your precious Will Power only on things that really matter. Don’t sweat the small stuff.</p>
<p><a href="./Akrasia.html">Akrasia</a> has declared war on you. It is like a wealthy kingdom laying siege on a poor kingdom. If you try to fight it <a href="./All-the-difference-in-the-world.html">conventionally</a> on its terms, it will just wear you down. It knows you’re gonna cave in sooner or later. Choose your battles wisely.</p>

<h1 id="ps">PS</h1>
<p>Ok. Tonight, I started getting more into the flow of things. Started getting a couple of more ideas regarding Will Power and how we can use it well.</p>
<p>Will bring out practical Actions and stuff as we move along in this Sequence.</p>

<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: One essay per day -or- several essays per day and several days per essay?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="why">Why?</h1>
<p>Can’t type a lot everyday. But to do a topic full justice, I need to write a lot of stuff to discover where the real meat is. I can’t think of any way to do that except by writing long essays. Remember, expressing ideas helps form them. Plus, I’m gonna be writing <em>solely</em> about Important topics from now (see: <a href="./The-Big-Problems.html">Big Problems</a>) so it’s doubly important that I give it everything I have.</p>
<p>I want to write <a href="http://www.gwern.net/About#long-content">Long Content</a> - content that will stand the test of time. I have never been a fan of the blogging format. Almost all of my favourite online authors are on a static site - Paul Graham and Steve Yegge. I think Eliezer only did daily posts cos he writes better that way.</p>
<p>I will get the chance to write quick and dirty mini-essays on pretty much every single idea that seems important to me in the moment. That will <a href="./The-Blasted-Backlog-Problem-part-1.html#expiry-date">clear my mind</a> and allow me to think greater thoughts. I will be able to process my existing ideas and mine them for gems systematically, and at the same time, set my brain to work on exploring new territory.</p>
<p>I can keep accumulating new insights and growing my garden of ideas. At any point, if I get a stroke of brilliance (happens once in a while) or discover I’d missed something, I can just go in and improve the essay. Slowly, the essays should become more and more polished.</p>
<p>Wait a minute! I just realized! Long Content writing is basically a form of Rapid Prototyping. I will be improving the essay over several iterations. And the time in between will provide the distance to give myself accurate feedback. Which means that, as time goes by, I will be Tightening the Loop on each essay. After a bunch of iterations, I should expect to be hitting the Target squarely. So, with time, my essays will become more and more accurate and insightful. They will give us maximum bang for the buck as they mature.</p>
<p>This site can then be a true extension of my own mind. My aim will be to record (crudely maybe) <em>every single existing</em> worthwhile idea in my head in an essay here. That will let me scrutinize and strengthen each one. Then, I can base my actions on these beliefs with confidence because they have been vetted by the essay-writing process of explaining to a neutral, smart, imaginary reader.</p>
<h1 id="why-not-before">Why not before?</h1>
<p>Cos I wanted to write one essay everyday and post it online as part of <a href="./The-Great-300-Word-Experiment.html">The Great 300-Word Experiment</a>. It was basically because I wanted to have something everyday to show my esteemed co-conspirator, Mr. Agent. Now, after the <a href="./The-Portrait-Corollary.html">Portrait Corollary</a>, that is not as much of a priority.</p>
<p>Plus, frankly, at the time, I didn’t want to start doing something that you couldn’t do on a normal blogging platform like Wordpress (Long Content and Blogs don’t easily go together). Why? I was afraid my co-conspirator might use that as an excuse to not continue on the Great 300-Word Experiment. He was already having second thoughts. No longer a valid excuse.</p>
<p>Mainly, I never imagined I would write more than one essay per day. Heck, just writing one essay was hard enough :P</p>
<p>Earlier, I was afraid I wouldn’t get the feeling of Closure and Achievement that I get when I tie up the loose ends on a new essay every night. Right now, I’m willing to risk that. I suspect I will make up for this by starting out on lots of fresh and exciting new essays that I would miss out on otherwise. I won’t have to wait till I work through a whole <a href="./The-Blasted-Backlog-Problem-part-1.html">backlog</a> of ideas before I can start having new ones. That will speed up my thought process and make me work at the edge of my abilities.</p>
<p>Plus, I predict Closure will not be a problem. I plan to write by Rapid Prototyping. Which means, at each point of time, I will have a “complete” essay. I will feel like I have done a substantial and satisfying quantum of work everyday.</p>
<p>Yes, the in-progress-yet-complete essay won’t cover the full breadth of the topic. So what? Earlier, I didn’t want to publish a half-done essay because I wanted to present the best version to my friend. I didn’t want bits of skeleton and internal tissue poking out. I wanted it to look good. Well, f*ck <em>that</em> now. Essays are for Becoming Stronger. Period.</p>
<h1 id="caution">Caution</h1>
<p>Don’t type more than you would have otherwise. No more than 800 words or so per day.</p>
<h1 id="credit">Credit</h1>
<p>I first came across this idea of a static site with awesome content when I spent hours on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/blog-rants">Stevey’s old site</a>. That was just so clean and awesome! No stupid “Posts by month” or “Archive” or “Categories” crap. All his essays on the side bar. Enjoy.</p>
<p>Then, of course, was Thalaivar <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">Paul Graham</a>. His site is the extreme version - 100+ essays all listed on one page. Enjoy. Pure and simple. Access the clarity and wisdom and insight and sheer Paul-Grahamness of all his essays from one easy plain-text list.</p>
<p>I heard this whole idea of Long Content formally from another static site, <a href="gwern.net">gwern.net</a> - specifically on this page - <a href="http://www.gwern.net/About#long-content">Long Content</a>. His idea really is seductive - start off with whatever little content you have. Then, keep building up on it as time passes. Add new thoughts, new references, whatever. Within a few years, you will have a masterful grasp of the topic and your essay will have grown to reflect that awesomeness. And your readers get to enjoy the best of your knowledge at each moment. Sounds cool. I plan to be around for years, don’t you?</p>
<h1 id="ps-ideas">PS: Ideas</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>I have been f*cking zig-zagging backward and forth this whole essay :). An idea here, one more idea there, an additional point here… there’s been a cascade of ideas coming through! Even now, I jumped out of a paragraph to add this “PS”. Gotta go…</p></li>
<li><p>[2014-10-13 Mon] Like everything else I’m doing, this is an Experiment right now. Let’s see how it goes for a week or so.</p></li>

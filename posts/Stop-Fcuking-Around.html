<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: Why do I keep writing for others?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="not-writing-for-others">Not Writing for Others</h1>
<p>I <a href="./Portrait-of-the-Writer-as-an-Ignorant-Fool.html">keep</a> <a href="./The-Double-Edged-Sword-of-Essays.html">talking</a> <a href="./Writing-for-Others.html">about</a> how I don’t want to write for others, how writing for others is getting me nowhere, and how I have a million ways in which I need to improve.</p>
<p>What have I done about that? Who am I still writing for?</p>
<p>I keep imagining these future readers. I hope that in the future, people will actually read the blog and get convinced and do stuff about it.</p>
<h1 id="reality-check">Reality Check</h1>
<p>Well… what do the numbers say?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Chances that people will read these essays</p>
<p>Next to zero.</p>
<p>Why? Cos no one reads them.</p></li>
<li><p>Chances of them being convinced by the <del>ideas</del> shoelaces</p>
<p>They need to be pretty open-minded and growth-oriented already to take what I’m saying. Then, even if they did agree that these shoelaces are right, they won’t <a href="./Regret-without-Action.html">take any action</a> on them.</p></li>
<li><p>Value of the action they may take</p>
<p>Even if they do take action, it will be pretty feeble, like a lone candle in the wind. It won’t be long before it is extinguished.</p>
<p>How do I know that? Cos I wrote all these essays and I have done bull-squat about any of the ideas. To expect anybody else to come and take it on is just optimistic to the point of foolishness.</p>
<p>Plus, remember, these aren’t even ideas. They’re just shoelaces. They aren’t proven to have any impact.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, the probability of someone else reading this stuff, getting convinced, and taking action is very low. Even if they do, the value of the action they take will be very low because humans suck at these kinds of things by default.</p>
<p>Hence, the expected value, which is the probability times the value is very very low.</p>
<p>Which means, I shouldn’t be f*cking writing for others at all.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="the-problem-with-writing-for-others">The problem with writing for others</h1>
<p>(Yes, this is a repetition. Bear with me. Remember the <a href="./Recap-Week-Four.html#what-is-the-skill-of-all-mothers-and-the-mother-of-all-skills">Mother of all Skill</a>.)</p>
<p>The problem is that when I’m writing for others, I’m almost certainly not writing for myself. When I write for others, I’m writing about topics that I think I <em>know</em>, ideas that I have <em>understood</em>. And so, it ends up seeming to my mind like I’m getting nothing out of the essay.</p>
<p>Examples? The initial essays on Akrasia and Will Power. I’ve known about these things for a while now. I felt like those were the most crap essays I have ever written. The worst essay I’ve written about a difficult topic comes nowhere near these essays in terms of sucking. These just suck balls. In the essays where I struggled, I got something out of it. I came out of it stronger. Here, I came out with nothing.</p>
<p>Then, there is the desire to please. I want to write well so that others will praise me and shit. They will say (in the future), “Ah… nice essays… nice writing… I like it. I’ll read more and I will get convinced.” In fact, whether they get convinced or not isn’t even the point to my mind. It is just great that they like it and think I’m worth something.</p>
<p>These two forces - writing about ideas I “understand” and writing to please others - make me focus on essay topics that are diametrically <em>opposite</em> to the topics that will be good for me.</p>
<h1 id="the-real-way-ahead">The Real Way Ahead</h1>
<p>The truth is - the <em>single best way</em> hands down to convince all those future people is for me to make myself stronger. Everything else will come. The stronger I am the better I will write / put across my ideas / train others. The stronger I am, the more I will achieve and the more people will pay attention to what I’m saying.</p>
<p>The equation is trivial. If what I really want is to improve the lives of those future readers and make them awesome, what I should focus on is <strong>making myself stronger</strong>.</p>
<p>Not 30% of my attention or 50% or 60%. It’s not that I should focus a lot on making myself stronger and then spend the remaining energy on trying to convince them.</p>
<p>Nope. The way ahead is clear. Focus <em>completely</em> on trying to make myself stronger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yo, motherf*cker! Even if you gave it everything you had, you still wouldn’t become 10% stronger. And here you are, giving it 1% of your attention, and spending the rest of your precious little mental energy on trying to make it look good for future generations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amen. Focus <strong>only</strong> on improving yourself for now.</p>
<p>When the time comes, you will convince others. Right now, you have neither the awesome life-changing ideas nor the ability to persuade others. What the f*ck do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p>Focus <strong>only</strong> on improving yourself for now.</p>
<h1 id="keeping-it-real">Keeping it Real</h1>
<p>I’ve come to <a href="./Writing-for-Others.html">that conclusion</a> before. In past essays, I’ve realized this exact same thing. What’s different now?</p>
<p>Well, what did I do about it before? I just <em>said</em> that I would <em>try</em> to not write for others. <del>No Action, No Right to Talk.</del> There was nothing to ensure I would absolutely not write for others at all.</p>
<p>I don’t pretend to have a complete solution now. That shouldn’t stop me from taking the best action I can think of.</p>
<p>The main problem seems to be that the opinions of future readers is influencing my actions. How do we take them out of the picture?</p>
<p>Here’s my plan: I will <strong>delete</strong> every post two weeks after I publish it. Nobody will ever get to read any of them after two weeks. No future readers, nothing.</p>
<p>Why two weeks? Why even publish the essays in the first place? Why not just write them on my computer? I’ve answered this <a href="./Why-write-Blog-posts.html#why-publish-it-online">before</a>. It forces me to actually make sense in reality instead of just making sense <em>in my head</em>. Writing for others will make you put your thoughts explicitly and in full. There won’t be any gaps that you can hand-wave over, the way you can do it while thinking alone.</p>
<p>In other words, I want to write for others without writing <em>for</em> others. Fun.</p>
<h1 id="returning-to-the-mother-city">Returning to the Mother City</h1>
<p>You know what, I need to make this site get back to its roots.</p>
<p>It needs to live up to its name.</p>
<p>It needs to be “SPK’s Rationality Training Ground” - the ground where SPK f*cking trains hard for Rationality. Not training for others. Training for SPK. This is not “Other-People-in-the-Future’s Rationality Training Ground”. This is “SPK’s Rationality Training Ground”. And so it shall be.</p>
<p>This is why I kept tripping up. I tried writing posts to get my ass moving on the real hard problems that are staring me in the face every minute. Nothing came of it. Because, somewhere deep down, I was still writing partly for others.</p>
<p>It was like I was cooking the main course for others and eating the left-overs on the table. Sure, they were delicious but they have nowhere near the impact of having the whole main course yourself. You don’t become a strong warrior by eating left-overs on the table. You need every single bit of nutrition you can get if you want to become strong.</p>
<p>This is what it is gonna be about. Obtaining food and consuming it fully myself. Cooking it with the express purpose of nourishing my mind. Not caring about how it tastes to others, how it looks, nothing. All that matters is the impact it has on my mind.</p>

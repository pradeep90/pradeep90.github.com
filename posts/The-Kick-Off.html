<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What should we <em>not</em> do in the initial stages in trying to master a skill?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="love">Love</h1>
<p>I think it would be a grave mistake to focus on strict, sober measurements right from the beginning of your grueling 10,000 hours of struggle and pain. Man! Just imagine how harsh that sounds. It drains away all the excitement you have.</p>
<p>That is <em>not</em> the way to go.</p>
<p>You have to pave the road to mastery with Love and Motivation initially. That is what will keep you going forward. Without that, you may seem to be making progress initially, but it will all fizzle out soon.</p>
<p>In a study mentioned in The Talent Code, researchers found that highly skilled pianists had average or just better than average teachers when they were starting out. And not just for a year or so, for about <em>six</em> years. What? Isn’t that bad? Shouldn’t you get some coach who will give you awesome detailed Deliberate Practice exercises and make you do your infinite hours of practice?</p>
<p>Well, Deliberate Practice is the engine that will take you to mastery of a skill, but Motivation is the only way to fly that engine. And it seems those initial non-world-class teachers were brilliant at generating tons of love and motivation for the field within the student. They gave lots of positive reinforcement, lots of praise and approval, and gentle but firm feedback so that the students could make continuous progress. It was an occasion for the students to go to their lessons.</p>
<p>You can have the best Deliberate Practice plan in the world, but if you would rather be playing video games or watching sitcoms or something, it is of no use.</p>
<p>Whereas, if you have Motivation, if you feel a <em>strong urge</em> within you to know more about the field and master the skills, you will automatically find the Deliberate Practice training to help you out.</p>
<h1 id="no-nos">No-Nos</h1>
<p>So, during the initial phases, I think we should focus more on making it exciting and interesting than on following Deliberate Practice principles to the letter.</p>
<p>Ditto for counting the number of hours of practice or whatever and trying to hit a certain number of hours everyday. You’re just dooming yourself to failure. That plane will never fly. This is what we call <em>premature optimization</em> - trying to get things “faster” or “better” without even knowing what <em>really</em> matters.</p>
<p>The initial stages are periods of high uncertainty. You don’t know where you need to go. You don’t know how to get there. You don’t know if you can do it. You don’t know if all this is just a bunch of bullshit. You don’t know nothing about nothing.</p>
<p>Trying to be all professional and mathematical by designing a good “training regimen” and stuff right from the beginning - you’re just choking your plans to death.</p>
<p>Throw out your clock and progress reports. Focus on getting to <em>love</em> the field you want to master. It should become the most important thing in your life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But it already is!” – Dumbass</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope. You just tell yourself it is. Are you <em>excited</em> about doing some more of that stuff? That’s the only question that matters.</p>
<h1 id="time">Time</h1>
<p>Don’t plan on spending a lot of time practicing. Instead, focus more on learning about the field and getting excited about the stuff there.</p>
<p>As you keep going forward, you will automatically start increasing the amount of practice you do. And since you will be pumped up about the skill, you will put a lot more into it.</p>
<h1 id="ps-ideas">PS: Ideas</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Excitement, not Training Regimen</p>
<p>btw, all the No-Nos I listed above were mistakes I made myself. Ouch.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: Who should you respect? How much?</p>
<h2 id="stupid-question">Stupid question</h2>
<p>Isn’t it obvious? We should respect Gandhiji, <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2003/10/mommie_dearest.html">Mother</a> <a href="http://heathensguide.wordpress.com/2008/12/08/good-and-evil-from-hitler-to-mother-teresa/">Teresa</a>, our parents, people from other castes, and women.</p>
<p>What’s the fuss about?</p>
<p>Let’s move away from the controversial stuff. I don’t care too much directly about what you think of Mother Teresa or women or Africans (<a href="./Regret-without-Action.html">Why not?</a>).</p>
<h2 id="simple-question">Simple question</h2>
<p>Who will you respect more?</p>
<p>(Solutions towards the end)</p>
<h4 id="great-ideas">Great ideas</h4>
<p>Guy A says that he has come across all kinds of superb life-changing ideas. But he is just not able to do anything about them because they “don’t sink deep enough to overcome my feelings”.</p>
<p>Guy B sits on his couch and watches TV all day.</p>
<p>Who do you respect more?</p>
<ul>
<li>Guy A</li>
<li>Guy B</li>
<li>Respect both the same</li>
</ul>
<p>Why?</p>
<h4 id="the-next-j-k-rowling">The next J K Rowling</h4>
<p>Guy A wants to write. He has been saying for years that writing is insanely important and that everyone should write as much as they can. He has written exactly 0 posts in the last 6 months.</p>
<p>Guy B sits on his couch and watches TV all day.</p>
<p>Who do you respect more?</p>
<ul>
<li>Guy A</li>
<li>Guy B</li>
<li>Respect both the same</li>
</ul>
<p>This was pretty easy.</p>
<h4 id="in-the-context-of-the-upcoming-elections">In the context of the upcoming elections:</h4>
<p>Guy A argues vociferously against Modi.</p>
<p>Guy B argues back saying that all politicians are just as corrupt and evil and that Modi isn’t any different from all those Congress people.</p>
<p>Guy C sits on his couch and watches TV all day.</p>
<p>Who do you respect most?</p>
<ul>
<li>Guy A</li>
<li>Guy B</li>
<li>Guy C</li>
<li>Respect all of them the same</li>
</ul>
<p>Hmmm… Which one do we pick?</p>
<p>Guy A, perhaps, for being courageous and stuff? Or maybe Guy B, for being a bit more thoughtful and broad-minded?</p>
<p>Or maybe there’s no difference and we respect them equally?</p>
<h2 id="tougher-questions">Tougher questions</h2>
<h4 id="social-dynamics">Social Dynamics</h4>
<p>Guy A learns about how to have more confidence in life from various psychology resources. He goes ahead and has exactly zero rise in confidence in life over the next one year. Every day, he becomes more depressed seeing how much he has failed.</p>
<p>Guy B <del>sits on his couch and watches TV all day</del> goes through life unaware of how much he is missing out cos of lack of confidence.</p>
<p>Guy A can see very clearly that Guy B could be way better off. Guy A knows that if Guy B just listened to him for a few minutes, Guy B’s entire life would be changed. He would become a better person in every way. That’s how bad Guy B’s life sucks now.</p>
<p>Who do you respect more?</p>
<ul>
<li>Guy A</li>
<li>Guy B</li>
<li>Respect both the same</li>
</ul>
<p>Why?</p>
<h4 id="advanced-research">Advanced Research</h4>
<p>Guy A works at the R&amp;D center of a low-cost car manufacturer. His team is designing a new fuel-conserving carburettor that can reduce the energy wasted in automobiles by 3%. Like any research lab, 95% of the ideas in the lab never get used in real world because they are either too impractical to be operationalized or too costly.</p>
<p>Guy B is a lead mechanic at a major garage. He doesn’t do any research work or anything. Just normal everyday work. He earns as much as Guy A.</p>
<p>Who do you respect more?</p>
<ul>
<li>Guy A</li>
<li>Guy B</li>
<li>Respect both the same</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="languages">Languages</h4>
<p>Guy A knows 4 languages.</p>
<p>He has bought a house in Chennai and is planning to retire there with his wife after three more years. He won’t be travelling much cos of poor health and only likes to watch Tamil movies.</p>
<p>Guy B knows just two - his mother tongue and English.</p>
<p>He has bought a house in Chennai and is planning to retire there with his wife after three more years. He won’t be travelling much cos of poor health and only likes to watch Tamil movies.</p>
<p>Who do you respect more?</p>
<ul>
<li>Guy A</li>
<li>Guy B</li>
<li>Respect both the same</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-biggest-difference-in-the-world">The biggest difference in the world</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>How dare you differentiate between different kinds of people? All people are the same and must be treated equally!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What was I trying to say in <a href="./Regret-without-Action.html">Regret without Action</a>?</p>
<p>Discussion on the questions above:</p>
<h4 id="life-changing-ideas-the-imaginary-writer">Life-changing ideas + The imaginary writer</h4>
<p>You say you have all kinds of beliefs. But if at any time in the past, present, or future, there is little or no observable difference between you and another person who doesn’t have those beliefs, what’s the point of having those beliefs?</p>
<p><a href="./Regret-without-Action.html">No Action, No Right to Talk</a>.</p>
<h4 id="the-political-debaters">The political debaters</h4>
<p>You have all these arguments with people. If the world is exactly same at the end of the argument as it was at the beginning of the argument, what the f*ck was the point of your argument?</p>
<p>Sure, you feel all self-righteous and stuff. And you wanna choke the other guy to death. Apart from that?</p>
<p>“What else can I do? I’m just an ordinary [insert your excuse].”</p>
<p>Well, you can shut the f*ck up and go do what you would have otherwise done.</p>
<p>Take Action. Show me the difference made in the world because of you.</p>
<p>Until then, Shut the F*ck Up and Simply Take Action.</p>
<p><a href="./Regret-without-Action.html">No Action, No Right to Talk</a>.</p>
<h4 id="social-dynamics-guy">Social Dynamics guy</h4>
<p>Show me some success in your own life. Until you can show real, tangible, hard-core success in front of my eyes, Shut the F*ck Up and Simply Take Action.</p>
<p><a href="./Regret-without-Action.html">No Action, No Right to Talk</a>.</p>
<h4 id="advanced-research-guy">Advanced Research guy</h4>
<p>Show me the real impact made on the world. It needn’t even be immediate stuff you’re doing. It could be something done by similar people who are a few years ahead on the path you’re following.</p>
<p>Until you can do that, you will get absolutely no more respect than the lowly mechanic who’s doing - <em>gasp</em> - absolutely no research at all.</p>
<p>Cos you will both have the same impact on the world (as far as research goes) - none.</p>
<p><a href="./Regret-without-Action.html">No Action, No Right to Talk</a>.</p>
<p>To be more precise: No Impact on the World, No Right to Talk.</p>
<p>(Why is that more precise? What not just say “Action”? Is it possible to busy taking action all day without having any real impact on the world?)</p>
<h4 id="language-expert-guy">Language expert guy</h4>
<p>Unless it has an impact on your quality of life, don’t expect any more respect.</p>
<p>Why not? Doesn’t he have the <em>potential</em> to achieve more than Guy B?</p>
<h2 id="potential-argument">Potential argument</h2>
<p>The biggest counter-argument people will probably give is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, there hasn’t been a difference till now. But Guy A has <strong>more potential</strong> to change the world. He can make a huge difference in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so it is said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He who dies with the most potential… should have used it more and left less to our imagination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No Impact on the World, No Right to Talk.</p>

<p>Lots more on this coming soon.</p>

<h1 id="legally-blind">Legally Blind</h1>
<p>In law, they have this saying that a person is innocent until proven guilty. The burden of proof is on the prosecution to collect enough convincing evidence to show that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt. (source: Wikipedia)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Snape’s nasty smile widened.<br /></p>
<p>“I suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not being entirely truthful,” he said. “It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story. I personally feel he should be taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is ready to be honest.”<br /></p>
<p>“Really, Severus,” said Professor McGonagall sharply, “I see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch. This cat wasn’t hit over the head with a broomstick. There is no evidence at all that Potter has done anything wrong.”<br /></p>
<p>Dumbledore was giving Harry a searching look. His twinkling lightblue gaze made Harry feel as though he were being X-rayed.<br /></p>
<p>“Innocent until proven guilty, Severus,” he said firmly.<br /></p>
<p>– Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several times in our personal lives, there are times when we wonder whether we are behaving in accordance with our values, whether we are doing good by someone. They are like legal cases where someone, a friend or our own conscience, is checking whether we are guilty of acting unfairly or unethically.</p>
<p>So, for example, when somebody asks us, “Why did you stop being friends with Guy A?”, we say that it was because he wasn’t treating us well or that he had started doing bad stuff and so on.</p>
<p>The question doesn’t have to come from outside, of course. For example, when I ask myself in my own mind, “Why don’t I eat lunch with Guy B?”, the answer comes - “He’s not very open-minded. He keeps making illogical arguments and doesn’t even listen to reason. He just ridicules ideas without thinking about their real significance. I don’t respect that.”</p>
<p>And, since we are innocent until proven guilty, unless someone discovers a smoking gun somewhere, we are basically not guilty. I wasn’t wrong in breaking off the friendship with that guy. I wasn’t wrong in disliking that guy.</p>
<p>Cool. All is well, right?</p>
<h1 id="am-i-a-bad-guy">Am I a Bad Guy?</h1>
<p>That is a pretty sound principle, right? It means that we don’t consider somebody guilty unless we actually have evidence against them. How can you possibly even <em>think</em> of someone as guilty unless you have proper evidence against them? It just degenerates into prejudice.</p>
<p>That is for the case when the prosecutor is another person who will do due investigation of the facts.</p>
<p>What happens when <em>you</em> are the prosecutor?</p>
<p>What happens when you ask yourself, in essence, this:</p>
<p>“At this moment, I am not actually a guilty person. There is no evidence to show that I have done anything wrong or unethical. Hmmm… okay, now I have to search for some evidence that I actually have some hidden motives or nasty thoughts that are making me do this thing for which I also have a plausible sounding excuse.”</p>
<p>So you query your mind:</p>
<p>“Am I a bad guy? Do I have some dark motive behind avoiding this person? Am I actually doing it out of ego? Am I reluctant to admit that I am wrong? Am I trying to protect my own interests here at the expense of the truth?”</p>
<p>Your mind searches itself for some “reasonable evidence” that any of these things are true. It comes back:</p>
<p>“Hey, no. I can’t find any real strong evidence. You don’t seem to be doing anything wrong. Nah… it doesn’t seem to be because of ego… C’mon, man… it’s a fact that that guy is being close-minded and stuff. Look at evidence A, B, and C. Yup, he is definitely not listening to reason. Surely you’re justified in breaking it off with him. You’re not reluctant to admit that you’re wrong. Don’t you remember that time X, and then Y, and Z where you admitted you were wrong. You are not that kind of person. You always try to stick to the truth, man…”</p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Not Guilty.</p>
<h1 id="a-convincing-tale">A Convincing Tale</h1>
<p>What happened there?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first principle is that you must not fool yourself - and you are the easiest person to fool.</p>
<p>– Richard Feynman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not like you’re deliberately trying to fool yourself. It just happens. It happens to everyone all the time.</p>
<p>When you “try to search” for evidence that you’re harbouring dark motivations, it is easy to list out all the good things you’ve done in the past (see: <a href="./The-Need-to-Qualify.html">virtues</a>) and convince yourself that surely you’re not that kind of anti-social, psychopathic, child-molesting gay guy who steals candy from babies and has undesirable motives.</p>
<p>Remember, you don’t have to convince some external neutral judge here who will scrutinize your evidence carefully. <em>All</em> you have to do is convince yourself. And convincing yourself of something you want to believe is a piece of cake!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!”</p>
<p>– Upton Sinclair</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="the-verdict-we-want">The verdict we want</h1>
<p>The problem is this - we start off presuming that we are innocent. When we try to find evidence to convince ourselves that we are guilty, we inevitably run a shallow search that turns up empty. We run a sham investigation.</p>
<p>We want to believe we are innocent. Together with all the ways our mind emphasizes certain stuff (*<em>cough</em>* virtues) and conveniently forgets any undesirable truths, this means that we are screwed. We have a <em>huge</em> incentive to <em>ignore</em> the truth.</p>
<p>In other words, when we are prosecuting ourselves, it is easy to go from a state of “Not Guilty”, see a few bits of evidence, say that they are not convincing enough, and give a final verdict of “Not Guilty”.</p>
<p>Hmmm… so is the whole thing hopeless? Is it that we will never be able to get to the truth? Are we always gonna lie to ourselves? Do we <em>want</em> to lie to ourselves?</p>
<p>Nah, we are not essentially dishonest. We <em>want</em> to know the truth. The truth is gonna help us out. Knowing the truth about ourselves, good or no, is gonna help us fix our problems. It’s just that these subtle lies slip under the radar. We need to bring them back on the screen.</p>
<h1 id="the-verdict-we-deserve">The verdict we deserve</h1>
<p>What happens if you’re already considered Guilty by the court? Is it easy now to fool yourself and go to a state of “Not Guilty”? Nope. This time, it will take quite a bit of evidence to change your mind from “Guilty” to “Not Guilty”. If you try to give the same crap-ass, unconvincing, wishful-thinking bullshit as before, it will be totally transparent.</p>
<p>So, this time, you will have to give real good reasons to actually convince the judge that you are innocent. And, more often than not, you will be Guilty. We all do crap stuff for crap dishonourable reasons. Now at least, we will know that we’re doing so, and that’s half the battle right there.</p>
<p>“Why don’t I talk to Guy A?” “Because he constantly disrespects me and makes me feel bad. I don’t want that. That’s why I don’t talk to him.” - This may not be the truth, but it ain’t a bad starting point.</p>
<p>“Why don’t I like Guy B” “Because he insists on talking about crap ideas where I have nothing to contribute and I feel like a dumbass because of social proof.”</p>
<p>“Why did I get pissed off when that other guy answered the question in class?” “Cos I was envious and I felt like a loser”</p>
<p>Dark motivations are hard to admit to. No way in hell you’re gonna do that when you’re starting from the assumption that you’re Not Guilty. So, let’s remove the difficulty. Let’s start with the assumption that you <em>already</em> have those dark motivations. You can only rid yourself of those accusations by finding strong evidence.</p>
<p>When trying to discover our true (possibly dark) motivations for doing something, we are Guilty until proven Innocent.</p>

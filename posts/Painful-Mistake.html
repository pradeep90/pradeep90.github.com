<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What is the biggest mistake I’m making regarding my hand pain?</p>
<h1 id="prelude">Prelude</h1>
<p>Before we discuss the mistakes, let’s look at the problem in more detail.</p>
<p>Why haven’t I fixed this problem already?</p>
<p>I’ve had other problems in life, health problems even. Why did most of those get fixed when this didn’t? I had typhoid that one time. Went straight to the doctor. One week of medical leave and several throw-ups later, I was back in business. Problem solved.</p>
<p>What is different about my hand pain?</p>
<p>I think the most important characteristic is that it is not constant. It comes and goes. I have a period where it’s hurting real bad nearly every hour of the day and I’m seriously thinking of giving up all kinds of typing ever. And then, I have a period where there is literally zero pain and I’m chiding myself for having blown it out of proportion earlier. It feels like all my problems have gone away.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, that is the <em>exact</em> same pattern I have with my belly. Replace “pain” with “feeling fat” and “typing” with “eating crap”. And the results are the same. Despite noticing it on and off for years now, I still haven’t got my belly fat situation where I want (out of my body).</p>
<p>Why did I succeed in solving the problem of typhoid and fail miserably in combating hand pain and belly fat?</p>
<h1 id="intermittent-strikes">Intermittent Strikes</h1>
<p>I was <em>forced</em> to solve the typhoid problem because I literally couldn’t do anything. I had high fever and couldn’t think straight. I kept vomiting. Nothing was functioning. All I could do was lie straight on my bed and listen to songs. That was all.</p>
<p>Yup. You betcha ass I was motivated to do something about the problem. I went to the doctor several times. I took the medicines and stuff. Typhoid was the biggest problem in my life then and I wanted to do whatever I could to make it go away.</p>
<p>Hand pain, on the other hand :P, is like a mosquito. It doesn’t come and strike you over and over in a constant fashion. If lots of them did that, you would be motivated enough to f*cking go and take drastic measures to get rid of them. That would be the end of their story. So, they irritate you in bits and pieces. Enough to get their job done, but not enough to motivate you to take some serious action against them.</p>
<p>That’s the f*cking beauty of it. The pain is not acute enough to make me take serious action (whatever that might be) but it is not negligible either.</p>
<h1 id="why-am-i-worried">Why am I worried?</h1>
<p>Cos I have quite a few years left to live (I hope). And I’m gonna need to type a lot for the foreseeable future. (Hey! They should probably invent some usable non-hand-based interface to our computers that is capable of taking power-user level loads).</p>
<p>The pain keeps growing exponentially. Not cool.</p>
<p>The damage is being done - that is what I’m most worried about. I fear that there is actual physical breakdown happening in my hands. This way my hands will be useless after a while. Not cool.</p>
<p>If I’m gonna come up with some solution, and if any solution requires lots of thinking and programming and stuff, and if I need to type do that stuff, I need to come up with a solution while the pain is still tolerable. I need to act while I still can.</p>
<h1 id="the-one-mistake-to-ruin-them-all">The One Mistake to ruin them all</h1>
<p>That is why the biggest mistake would be to let the current state of affairs continue.</p>
<p>Case in point: yesterday, I was unable to type more than a few paragraphs. I had to stop. Today, it isn’t that bad. It feels ok. But it isn’t. It has started hurting again.</p>
<p>Things will progressively get worse but I won’t even realize that I’m losing my hands. I must not let my guard down when things seem to be “back to normal”. They aren’t. There is real damage happening.</p>
<p>Instead of taking action only in proportion to the pain <em>right now</em> (which keeps fluctuating), I need to take action in proportion to the total impact this shit will have on my future. If this prevents me from doing any typing after a few years, that is basically the end of my career as a programmer, thinker, whatever. I need to hold that accumulated future pain in mind and take lots of preventive action right now.</p>
<p>I cannot let this hand pain thing slip under the radar anymore.</p>
<p>(<em>to be continued</em>)</p>

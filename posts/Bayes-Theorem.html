<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: How do we pick out the best <a href="./Hypothetically-Speaking.html">hypothesis</a>?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="kick-off">Kick off</h1>
<p>We have a set of hypotheses about the world. At each point of time, you hold different levels of beliefs about these hypotheses. You believe some of them more than others (“Dhoni is a good batsman in pressure situations” vs “Dhoni crumbles under pressure”). You spread out your probability weight among them.</p>
<p>Ok. So, what is the initial state of our beliefs?</p>
<p>You’re in a new situation. You have pretty much no clue what’s going on. You would like to predict what’s gonna happen next. You have some hypotheses. But… which one should you believe most? How much probability weight should you put on each one?</p>
<p>Note that you <em>have</em> to bet. You have 100 points (100% probability) to divide among these hypotheses. You can’t refuse to bet, that is not allowed. This is an analogy for life - you’re playing with <a href="./The-Prediction-Game.html#dumbass-bet">everything</a> you have.</p>
<p>You have no evidence to choose between them, so the only way to judge the hypotheses initially is on… their Complexity.</p>
<p>How? Occam’s Razor. The simpler the hypothesis, the more you can believe that it is correct.</p>
<p>Cool. We’ve got some initial beliefs about our hypotheses. We’re ready to start.</p>
<p>How do we rule out hypotheses? How do we gain more belief in some hypothesis? How do we decrease our belief in some hypothesis?</p>
<p>By observing evidence. Evidence shifts the belief levels of our hypotheses.</p>
<h1 id="evidence-makes-the-difference">Evidence makes the Difference</h1>
<p>Evidence distinguishes between Hypotheses.</p>
<p>How do you choose between hypotheses? You look at where they make <em>differing predictions</em>.</p>
<p>“Dhoni rocks under pressure” says that he will finish and win lots of matches in crunch situations for India. “Dhoni sucks under pressure” says that he will rarely ever succeed in crunch situations. Awesome! We have got differing predictions. That’s it. It is now one or the other. If you look at the evidence and find that he is the Father of all Finishers, it is game over for the loser hypothesis.</p>
<p>This is what Scientific Experiments are all about. Find out the point where two hypotheses make hugely different predictions and run an <em>experiment</em> which will bring out evidence there.</p>
<p>But, there aren’t always hugely differing predictions. We can handle the case where hypotheses make exactly opposite predictions. But what if one guy says something will happen with a likelihood of 20% and the other guy says it will happen with a likelihood of 30%? What now? Should we just do nothing?</p>
<p>Enter Mr. BT</p>
<h1 id="the-epic-awesome-mr.bayes-theorem">The Epic Awesome Mr. Bayes Theorem</h1>
<p>We know our current beliefs about the hypotheses (Prior Odds). We want to know our beliefs after looking at the evidence (Posterior Odds). How do we get from Prior Odds to Posterior Odds?</p>
<p>Here you go:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Posterior odds</strong> = <strong>Prior odds</strong> * <strong>Likelihood ratio</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Prior odds</strong> represent our probability estimates for the hypotheses before seeing the evidence.</p>
<p>Prior odds = Prior probability for H : Prior probability for ~H</p>
<p>where H is this hypothesis, and ~H is the other hypothesis (e.g., heads vs tails)</p>
<p><strong>Posterior odds</strong> tells us our probability estimates for the hypotheses after updating on the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Likelihood Ratio</strong> says whether the evidence strongly supports or contradicts any hypotheses. <em>This</em> captures predictions which differ only in likelihood. <em>This</em> will help us distinguish between subtly different hypotheses.</p>
<p>Likelihood ratio for some evidence = Likelihood of seeing this evidence given H / Likelihood of seeing this evidence given ~H</p>
<p>If one hypothesis predicts something with more likelihood than another, then it will have a Likelihood Ratio &gt; 1, therefore its Odds will increase. The hypothesis which gave the smaller likelihood will have Likelihood Ratio &lt; 1, therefore its Odds will decrease. This matches our intuition - the hypothesis that predicted actual events with more certainty should be more true than the hypothesis that was more vague.</p>
<h1 id="worked-out-example">Worked-out Example</h1>
<p>Problem statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1% of women at age forty who participate in routine screening have breast cancer. 98% of women with breast cancer will get positive mammographies. 9.8% of women without breast cancer will also get positive mammographies. A woman in this age group had a positive mammography in a routine screening. What is the probability that she actually has breast cancer?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prior odds of a woman having breast cancer = 1:99 (because probability = 1% = 1/100. So odds = 1:(100 - 1))</p>
<p>If you have breast cancer, likelihood of getting positive mammography = 98%</p>
<p>If you don’t have breast cancer, likelihood of getting positive mammography = 9.8%</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You get a positive mammography. Damn. It means you have breast cancer, right? Isn’t that a distinguishing evidence? I mean, look, if you have breast cancer, 98% chance you will get positive mammography. And you <em>got</em> positive mammography. That means it’s 98% likely you have cancer! Right? OMG OMG OMG. I’m freaking out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait…</p>
<p>Likelihood ratio for getting a positive mammography = 98 / 9.8 = 10</p>
<p>Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = (1:99) * 10 = 10 : 99</p>
<p>In probability terms, that is 10 / (10 + 99) = 0.0917 = <strong>9.17%</strong></p>
<p>Posterior probability after the test result is <strong>9.17%</strong> that you have breast cancer.</p>
<h1 id="the-laws-of-reasoning">The Laws of Reasoning</h1>
<p>Wait a minute! Even after getting a positive f*cking mammography, your probability is still less than 10%.</p>
<p>Holy Crap! Imagine what we would think by default: we would take a positive test result to mean that <em>for sure</em> we have cancer.</p>
<p>Nope. That is plain wrong. This is a super counter-intuitive insight that Bayes Theorem gives us.</p>
<p><em>This</em> is why we need to think like Bayesians, not dumbasses. And this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Anywhere you need to come to correct beliefs, you <em>need</em> to use Bayes Theorem. Remember, there is <a href="./The-Prediction-Game.html#what-does-probability-mean">one correct answer</a> in Reality. Bayes Theorem is how we get to that correct answer. It’s not a tool or a cool technique. It is the fundamental Law of Reasoning.</p>
<p>You can’t just have any damn beliefs you want about the world. The only <em>correct</em> beliefs are those in accordance with the Laws of Reasoning. You may not be able to compute it at all times, but you must keep it in mind that there is a right answer and that any arbitrary beliefs you happen to hold are almost certainly wrong.</p>
<p>The more you use Bayes Theorem, the more you will get to correct beliefs, i.e., you will get to the Hypotheses with high Prediction Score. The more you violate this Law, the worse your Prediction Score will get.</p>
<p>And remember, your Prediction Score determines everything. We wanted to maximize Utility. For that, we found we need to maximize Prediction Score. For that, we found we need to discover Hypotheses with highest Prediction Score and lowest Complexity. And for <em>that</em>, we now realize, we need to use Bayes Theorem.</p>
<h1 id="evidence-and-likelihood-ratio">Evidence and Likelihood Ratio</h1>
<p>Bayes Theorem rewards hypotheses in proportion to the amount they <a href="./The-Prediction-Game.html">bet</a> on the winning outcome. What matters here is not the absolute bet your hypothesis makes, but your bet <em>relative</em> to the other hypotheses’ bets.</p>
<p>Make the right predictions, and more importantly, make them accurately where others are wrong. If you can keep your prediction accuracy when all around you are losing theirs, yours are the Posterior Odds and everything in them.</p>
<p>Those hypotheses that predicted the winning outcome will get pushed up. Those that didn’t will perish. That is what the <em>Likelihood Ratio</em> captures. The more uniquely you predict something, the more your Likelihood Ratio will be. The more you mis-predict like a dumbass, the less your Likelihood Ratio will be.</p>
<p>Likelihood Ratio = Likelihood of evidence given H / Likelihood of evidence given ~H</p>
<p>aka how much you said it would happen / how much the other guy said it would happen.</p>
<h1 id="strong-and-weak-evidence">Strong and Weak Evidence</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Strong Evidence in favour of your Hypothesis</p>
<p>You say it will happen for sure. He says it won’t happen at all. It happens. You win. He bites the dust.</p>
<p>You say 80% chance of happening.</p>
<p>The other hypothesis-guy says only 10% chance of happening.</p>
<p>It happens.</p>
<p>Your Likelihood Ratio for this evidence = 80 / 10 = 8.</p>
<p>This means your Posterior Odds = Prior Odds * 8.</p>
<p>Yay! Your Prior odds got multiplied by 8.</p>
<p>This is what we call <em>strong evidence</em> in favour of your hypothesis - Likelihood Ratio <em>much greater than 1</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Strong evidence against your Hypothesis</p>
<p>You say it will happen for sure (aka very low chance of it not happening). He says it won’t happen at all. It <em>doesn’t</em> happens. You lose. He rocks.</p>
<p>You say 80% chance of happening (so, only 20% chance of not happening).</p>
<p>The other hypothesis says only 10% chance of happening (90% chance of not happening).</p>
<p>It <em>doesn’t</em> happen.</p>
<p>Your Likelihood Ratio for this evidence = 20 / 90 = 2/9.</p>
<p>This means your Posterior Odds = Prior Odds * 2/9.</p>
<p>Damn! Your Prior odds got reduced by 2/9. Not cool.</p>
<p>This is what we call <em>strong evidence</em> against your hypothesis - Likelihood Ratio <em>much less than 1</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Weak Evidence</p>
<p>Weak Evidence is when Likelihood Ratio is pretty much around 1.</p>
<p>You say it will happen for sure, but he <em>too</em> says it will most likely happen. It happens. Cool. You get a bit of a boost, but not much, because he got it sorta right too.</p></li>
<li><p>Not Evidence either way</p>
<p>It ain’t evidence if it doesn’t distinguish between two hypotheses. If you say it will happen with 80% probability, and so does the other hypothesis, it doesn’t make any difference whether it happens or not. You know nothing more than you did before. Nobody wins.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="sharp-and-unique">Sharp and Unique</h1>
<p>The above discussion on Evidence means that Hypotheses that make sharp, <em>unique</em> predictions are generally more valuable than vague ones.</p>
<p>If they are wrong, we get to know it quickly because they bet everything on a few, specific outcomes and so will be penalized with a very low Likelihood Ratio if something else happens. All the other outcomes are Strong evidence <em>against</em> them.</p>
<p>And if they are right, then they Win like hell, because they will have very high Likelihood Ratio. It was a <em>unique</em> prediction. So, no one else predicted it. It was a <em>sharp</em> prediction. So, their likelihood for this outcome is very high. So the denominator is small and the numerator is high - bingo! Strong evidence <em>for</em> this hypothesis. Strong evidence <em>against</em> all the others. You have come to the truth about the matter - aka a Hypothesis with high Predictive Power. Exactly what you want.</p>
<h1 id="reasoning-using-bayes-theorem">Reasoning using Bayes Theorem</h1>
<p>Generate hypotheses about the world (or the specific thing you’re interested in). Collect evidence and update on them. Enjoy more accurate beliefs.</p>
<p>Also, run hypothesis tests to produce new evidence. Look at the possible hypotheses and see where they make <em>differing predictions</em>.</p>
<p>In Science, you generally look for differing predictions where they predict completely opposite things. That’s when you can run experiments. Experiments give you very <em>strong</em> evidence. In Science, generally only Experimental results get counted as evidence. Less straight-forward results are not given any weight formally. The problem is proper experiments are generally very cumbersome and expensive to run. And they can take a very long time to give you the strong evidence you desire.</p>
<p>In the Bayesian Way of Life, you squeeze the maximum information out of <em>every</em> piece of evidence, be it strong or weak. With Bayes Theorem, you can run quick and dirty hypothesis tests to start distinguishing between hypotheses <em>immediately</em>. You can keep updating on evidence and improve your model of the world incrementally.</p>
<p>This pays off big-time especially when the field doesn’t have clear-cut black-and-white data and you’re completely confused about what’s going on. Sound like much of our lives? More on the Bayesian Way coming soon.</p>

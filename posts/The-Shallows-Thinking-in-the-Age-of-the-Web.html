<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: Has the Web changed our way of thinking?</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is a work in progress, based on the excellent book The Shallows by Nicholas Carr.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-summaries-and-notes">Chapter Summaries and Notes</h1>
<p>These are <em>my</em> thoughts and inferences with the book’s ideas as a starting point. These may differ from the author’s ideas.</p>
<h2 id="the-vital-paths">The Vital Paths</h2>
<p>If you have high Motivation for something, you will do it a lot. Your brain optimizes what you do a lot (neuroplasticity) and thus you have more skill in that area. Now, your brain wants to use the circuits that it has optimized, so you have more Motivation for doing it, thus forming a reinforcing feedback loop of Motivation and Skill.</p>
<p>It works both ways: what you don’t do a lot, you become worse at. And presumably you have lower Motivation for that thing, making it weaker and weaker.</p>
<p>This is important to us in the context of directly competing skills, like reading books and surfing the web. If one of them is more exciting and motivating, we will do it a lot and gain skill and do it even more; consequently, we will do less of the other and lose skill and do it even less. Neither can live while the other survives! (sort of)</p>
<p>They are competing for attention and thus for skill growth. Even if they don’t drive each other out, and even if you do them both consistently, you will lose out on some other skills.</p>
<p>The amount of skill you grow in an area depends on the amount of attention you pay and the amount of Deliberate Practice you do. And you only have so much time. Therefore, you cannot be good at everything. There is an Opportunity Cost to pay.</p>
<p>Plus, you cannot direct your attention at will. Your Will Power depletes when you go against your impulses, so the natural Motivation you have for a task makes a big difference. If a task is more exciting than another, even if it is less productive, you will end up doing more of it (just like with unhealthy food).</p>
<p>So, Motivation is <em>crucial</em> in deciding what we become good at, but it isn’t always aligned with our goals. We desperately need to control it better.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="summary-and-book-review">Summary and Book Review</h1>
<p>Two chapters towards the end are stinkers. He makes a hue and cry about “Taylorism” and the principles of Scientific Management and how Google is being “Taylorist” by measuring behaviour at very fine-grained levels and trying to optimize for its goals.</p>
<p>Instead of using labels such as “Taylorist” or “Scientific Management” (which was used in the early twentieth century to optimize factory workers’ productivity), we should do what PG suggested - ask “Is it actually true?”. Or, in this case, is it actually evil?</p>
<p>Apart from that, the book was quite thought-provoking. I found it clearest to imagine the sea change we’ve gone through when he compared the Oral culture to the Written culture and then that culture to today’s Web culture. When you have three different data points like that, it’s easy to hold them against each other and see the pattern.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="neuroplasticity">Neuroplasticity</h1>
<p>The brain changes as you experience life.</p>
<p>In particular, the tasks you do over and over get large neural circuits in the brain dedicated to doing them better and faster.</p>
<p>And if you don’t use a particular skill too much, its circuit is gradually taken over by other circuits that you do use.</p>
<p>Also, your brain likes to do things for which it has built up circuits. So, you do that more, and the brain optimizes that circuit more, and a virtuous cycle ensues. That’s how habits are built up. Good or bad - it makes no difference to the brain. Do it a lot and it will get burnt into your brain.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, when you use a tool a lot - say, like the Emacs editor or your web browser or your smartphone or even pen and paper - some part of your brain comes to represent that tool and it “becomes part of you”. Working with that tool feels like just using any other part of your body. Neuroscientists have found a lot of evidence for this using monkeys, etc. This gives credence to sayings like “this bat has become an extension of my arm”. It really has, at least in your brain.</p>
<p>One consequence of that is that when that tool is taken away, you suddenly feel uncomfortable, almost handicapped. And just like with really handicapped people, if you don’t use that tool (or limb) much, your brain will assume that circuit for some other purpose. So, people who lose their vision will develop a keener sense of hearing and touch. Ditto for those who stop using a particular editor or programming language or thinking aid.</p>
<h1 id="the-medium-vs-the-message">The Medium vs the Message</h1>
<p>Carr contends that people argue at the level of the content of the medium. They talk about whether the content was useful or not. What gets missed out is the box the content came in.</p>
<p>I will say more about this in my next essay, which will be on The Medium and the Message and a book that has a lot to say about it. There, the focus will be on value judgments and how the medium shapes those.</p>
<p>Right now, I’ll simply talk about the skills that we develop due to a medium and, more importantly, the skills we let decay due to neglect.</p>
<h1 id="the-oral-culture">The Oral culture</h1>
<p>(from Tools of the Mind)</p>
<p>What speaking demands from you. What listening demands.</p>
<h1 id="the-written-culture">The Written culture</h1>
<p>(from the Deepening Page)</p>
<p>What writing demands from you (creativity, originality, etc.). What reading demands from you.</p>
<p>Intellectual achievement.</p>
<h1 id="the-web-culture">The Web culture</h1>
<p>“A Medium of the Most General Nature”</p>
<p>How we read.</p>
<p>How other mediums are being forced to change in the Web era.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<p>paraphrase - “Changes in reading style will also bring changes in writing style.”</p>
<p>groupiness</p>
<p>chatter</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Urgency</p>
<p>Obsession with the new - Feb 05</p>
<p>Most dangerous of all - “we convince ourselves that surfing the Web is a suitable, even superior, substitute for deep reading and other forms of calm and attentive thought.”</p>
<p>“permanent state of distractedness that defines the online life.”</p>
<p>How our thinking and information-consuming habits have changed.</p>
<p>positive reinforcement for being online.</p>
<p>Insistent - “commands our greater insistency than our television or radio or morning newspaper ever did”</p>
<p>Self-worth is at stake - “our social standing is, in one way or another, …” “terrific interest in knowing…”</p>
<h1 id="learning-and-understanding">Learning and Understanding</h1>
<p>“distracted by the medium’s rapid-fire delivery of competing messages and stimuli.”</p>
<p>“seductive blur”</p>
<p>“distracted from distraction by distraction”</p>
<p>“as the time we spend hopping across links crowds out the time …”</p>
<p>“The need to evaluate links and make related navigational choices…”</p>
<p>“The depth of our intelligence …”</p>
<p>“as we reach the limits of our working memory…”</p>
<p>“extraneous problem-solving” and “divided attention”</p>
<hr />
<p>Other quotes:</p>
<p>To turn off these alerts is to risk feeling out of touch</p>
<p>We vastly overvalue what happens to us right now</p>
<p>the new is often more trivial than essential</p>
<h1 id="the-lure-of-productivity">The Lure of “Productivity”</h1>
<p>Feeling like you’re achieving a lot.</p>
<p>(To be fair, this happens in book-reading too. Analyze.)</p>
<h1 id="distractions">Distractions</h1>
<p>With a physical book you have ZERO distractions. Think about that for a minute. There is NOTHING else you can do apart from reading. You can’t check your email or get a notification about new mails. You can’t get random pings or updates from Facebook. You can’t listen to music in a new browser tab or app. You can’t check the scores of the latest match online. All you can do is read. And yet, that is perhaps all we need.</p>
<h1 id="google-incentives">Google Incentives</h1>
<h1 id="actions">Actions</h1>
<p>Go without the Web or Web-based apps. No random checking of stuff either. Let’s see how important those urgent messages really are.</p>
<p>Get all your information from books.</p>
<h1 id="related-books">Related Books</h1>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Information Sources we use</p>
<p>Q: What is their nature? i.e., What are the constraints on the message and what are the demands on the producers and consumers?</p>
<ul>
<li>Gmail</li>
<li>Hangouts</li>
<li>WhatsApp</li>
<li>Music through some streaming app</li>
<li>Books (e-books, mostly)</li>
<li>TV Sitcoms</li>
<li>Sports matches</li>
<li>Text messages</li>
<li>Phone calls</li>
<li>Classroom instruction</li>
<li>Youtube</li>

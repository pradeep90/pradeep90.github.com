<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: TODO</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="edit-this-fairy-tales">Edit This: Fairy Tales</h1>
<p>Another reason why I was completely blind to this whole narrative of stagnation and non-progress, was that I was reading resources that were full of progress and optimism.</p>
<p>Science-Fiction. The Transhumanism movement. HPMOR and other Eliezer writings.</p>
<p>They all praised Rationality and the Scientific Method to the skies. Everything will be awesome, if you follow the Methods of Rationality, they said.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Lego Movie song takes on a new meaning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything <del>is</del> will be Awesome <br /> Everything <del>is</del> will be Cool when you follow Science <br /> Everything <del>is</del> will be <em>Awesome</em> <br /> When you’re living out your dream</p>
<p>– The Lego Movie, paraphrased</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, if you really do have Methods of Rationality, and if you do follow them right, you will make progress. That’s what Rationality is for. Rationality is nothing but doing actions that systematically maximize utility. Aka “Rationality is Systematized Winning”, as the <a href>saying</a> goes.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, I started questioning whether the so-called techniques we have learned really are all that awesome. I started wondering whether we had really learned any techniques. And I started wondering whether there really were some techniques at all, because if pretty much nobody had learned techniques properly, it meant that nobody had applied them properly, which means that nobody would be getting insane amounts of Win as advertised. And that seemed commensurate with the data. I don’t see anybody making epic amounts of progress using the Methods of Rationality. And I see <a href>plenty</a> of <a href>claims</a> going unchallenged that Rationality isn’t really that great and it won’t really change your life from top to bottom.</p>
<p>If my hypothesis is true, and if we don’t really have techniques and haven’t really learned them but just fooled ourselves that we have, and if nobody is really implementing these epic vaporware Methods of Rationality, then we won’t be making epic progress.</p>
<p>The whole reason why Rationality made me so optimistic was that you use powerful tools like the Scientific Method and other techniques to make progress. But if people aren’t doing that well, then you shouldn’t expect much progress, right?</p>
<h1 id="whence-this-optimism">Whence this optimism?</h1>
<p>I was brought around from my nihilistic, it’s-all-going-to-hell perspective to the Enlightenment ideals by Eliezer Yudkowsky, specifically through the epic fanfiction novel Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality.</p>
<p>Of course, if my beliefs are wrong, it’s my fault. I have to take responsibility for believing something, no matter who tells me stuff.</p>
<p>So, anyway, Harry Potter in this alternate-universe book is something of a genius, an extremely rational thinker / scientist, with his heart in the right place (brain, actually).</p>
<p>And you get to see him crack all kinds of nigh-impossible problems and generally kick ass in the book. He is meant to be an inspiration, I think, and he is magnificent at that. I get a renewed sense of hope and power when I read that book. <em>That</em> is who I want to be like.</p>
<p>Awesome. What’s not to like?</p>
<h1 id="awesomeness-ambition-and-confidence">Awesomeness, Ambition, and Confidence</h1>
<p>Well, there are two reasons why he / the book is so inspiring.</p>
<p>One is that he generally solves puzzles that are actually solvable <em>if</em> you take the right approach (aka the Scientific approach). His achievements are highlighted even more because those solutions would have eluded all of the great and experienced wizards in the magical world. Most people don’t think scientifically, not even scientists <a href>outside their lab</a>. So, it’s a visceral demonstration of the power of the Scientific Method.</p>
<p>Cool. Score One for the Scientific Method.</p>
<p>So, that’s the actual concrete value of the Scientific Method - the stuff it has been known to achieve (in real-life or fiction).</p>
<p>Then, there’s the other reason why the book is so seductive - Harry has extremely high ambitions. It’s not enough for him to just get the top marks in some exam, or maybe beat some other guys in a competition, or discover a couple of things in one single field somewhere. No. His vision goes far, far beyond that. Harry’s aim is to become as f*cking powerful as you can possibly become, to gain control over any and all parts of the universe, and make anything he wants happen. The aim is to become God, in other words.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You have problems,” said Neville. “You think you ought to be what Lesath Lestrange thinks you are.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said the Boy-Who-Lived, “that pretty much nails it. Every time someone cries out in prayer and I can’t answer, I feel guilty about not being God.” <br /> … <br /> Harry watched Neville leave.</p>
<p>Of course Harry hadn’t said what the solution was.</p>
<p>The solution, obviously, was to hurry up and become God.</p>
<p>– <a href="http://hpmor.com/chapter/27">HPMOR, Chapter 27</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, first of all, that is a worthy goal. If you can become God, you should. There is a lot of shit that happens in this world and we need to prevent it from happening.</p>
<p>Also, Harry has a lot of self-confidence. He has absolutely no doubt that he will be able to do what he wants. It’s just a question of which specific path, that’s all.</p>
<p>Now, when we see someone having inordinately high ambitions and a proportionate amount of confidence in themselves, it feels like they’re almost certainly going to get it done. I felt like, “It’s almost certain that Harry is going to be able to achieve whatever he wants. He has such powerful tools at his disposal. Surely, he’s gonna obtain that much strength.”</p>
<p>And I started absorbing that attitude myself. I started raising the level of my goals, and at the same time started believing that these awesome tools I had learned from Harry (the Scientific Method, the knowledge of our Heuristics and Biases, etc.) would surely take me a long way towards success in those endeavours. That sort of absolute self-confidence started rubbing off on me.</p>
<h1 id="potential-doesnt-count.">Potential doesn’t count.</h1>
<p>But… we need to separate facts from fantasy. We need to de-link power from potential.</p>
<p>(Note: I’m trying not to be too critical of either side here. I’m just trying to see what the truth is. I want to know <em>exactly</em> how hopeful I should be about science and technology.)</p>
<p>What, I think, was happening above was that I saw the lofty goals and the claims about the immense power of the tools, and I thought that the future was ours. We would make our dreams come true. However, the missing link was that the tools weren’t really proven to be of that much power.</p>
<p>The only way to judge the power of the tools is to look at what they have achieved so far. However, instead of looking at the concrete impact in the past, I was looking at the abstract <em>potential</em> in the future and getting all excited about it.</p>
<p>(Why does Potential not count? Cos it is easy to fool yourself that you’ve got it made without actually getting results in real life right now.)</p>
<h1 id="what-has-science-done-recently">What has Science done recently?</h1>
<p>People claimed that, in the future, Science will do this, Science will do that. Science will do everything. Science will help us solve all the problems we want to solve.</p>
<p>Well, yes. I believe that too. I believe Science <em>can</em> potentially solve all the problems we want to solve. In fact, <em>correct</em> thinking involves updating of beliefs using Science (Bayes Theorem, to be precise). So, if you are to come to accurate beliefs about the world, which you need to in order to understand and manipulate some part of the universe, you need to use Science, implicitly or explicitly.</p>
<p>That’s the theoretical potential.</p>
<p>But, what is the reality? How much really is Science going to help us, given all the crap constraints we are under in the 21st century, and our crap skills at wielding it? No Impact, No Right to Talk, remember?</p>
<p>If Science really were capable of giving us epic benefits with our current constraints, shouldn’t we have seen some signs of that by now?</p>
<p>I’m given to understand that people haven’t discovered too many revolutionary insights in Physics since the first half of the 20th century. That’s what Leonard says, anyway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Penny: So, what’s new in the world of physics?</p>
<p>Leonard: Nothing.</p>
<p>Penny: Really, nothing?</p>
<p>Leonard: Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930’s, and you can’t prove string theory, at best you can say “hey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.”</p>
<p>Penny: Ah. Well I’m sure things will pick up.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://bigbangtrans.wordpress.com/series-1-episode-3-the-fuzzy-boots-corollary/">The Fuzzy Boots Corollary, The Big Bang Theory</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also believe that medicine isn’t really making revolutionary leaps. It’s not like they’ve invented unthinkable new vaccines and cures in the last decade or so.</p>
<h1 id="the-greatness-of-science">The Greatness of Science</h1>
<p>To twist the knife in further, <a href>health economists</a> argue that medicine and health care isn’t really increasing our lifespans too much. And, even if they do, you don’t live the extra years healthily. It’s an endless merry-go-round of hospitals and medicines and therapies and whatnot.</p>
<p>What are the standard things that people claim as the awesome accomplishments of Science?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Man going to the Moon.</p>
<p>Well, what came of that? I get the feeling the whole space movement has fizzled out. You don’t see that much funding behind missions to send people to the Moon or Mars or anywhere. The whole reason why people were so excited about space travel was the idea that someday we would leave this Earth and colonize some other places and thereby increase the wealth and stuff of our civilization.</p>
<p>Say, if we ran out of resources here or wanted to escape some catastrophe threatening us. Or if we wanted to get some valuable resources out of other places (Unobtanium, mayhap)? That is why space travel was so awesome, IMHO, because it could increase our wealth / standard of living significantly. None of that shit seems likely anytime soon.</p></li>
<li><p>Curing diseases</p>
<p>Progress has somewhat stalled here, right? Cures for the big diseases - HIV, Cancer, Alzheimer’s, whatever else is killing people and costing us - are still elusive.</p></li>
<li><p>Nuclear Power</p>
<p>Where is that going?</p>
<p>What’s up with Nuclear Fusion? I vividly remember HC Verma, a physics textbook writer, mentioning in the last chapter of his introductory physics book that all hopes of mankind surviving past a couple of centuries rest on Nuclear Fusion. No other energy source has that much potential, according to him.</p>
<p>But, all I can hear about the N-word is that reactors are getting dismantled or ready to get dismantled or are unleashing radioactive doom on the general populace.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Anyway, I think I got carried away by the exuberance and self-confidence of Harry Potter and started thinking that we would be able to do whatever we set our mind to, using the powers of Science. All the inspirational work is good, all the things that Science can potentially do - that’s nice to hear, but we need concrete Impact, stuff that we have achieved right here, right now. Else, I fear we are building castles in the air.</p>
<h1 id="the-halo-around-science">The Halo around “Science”</h1>
<p>I think one reason why it’s hard to point out any flaws in Science is because we have this whole Aura of Awesomeness around the subject. Science is the crap papers that researchers might be putting out, it’s about the grandest achievements of mankind. Attacking Science is like attacking motherhood or something. We’re supposed to say only good things about it.</p>
<p>Because if we put the ideology aside, if we put the awesome achievements aside, sidestep all the glamour, and take a hard look at what it’s done - what do we find?</p>
<p>Also, note that nothing is “invaluable”. You can put a value on things. You have to, in fact. You face tradeoffs.</p>
<p>So, Science, just like a human life, has a specific value to us. And that’s how much respect it will get. Nothing more, nothing less - either way lies inefficiency.</p>
<p>How much value has Science really given us? More to the point, how much more value can it give us in the future?</p>
<h1 id="update-beliefs-based-on-the-idea-that-techniques-are-not-so-awesome.">Update beliefs based on the idea that Techniques are not so awesome.</h1>
<p>Now that you know we just fool ourselves about their epic-ness, can you really expect great progress?</p>
<h1 id="possible-counter">Possible Counter</h1>
<p>Scientific Research - hell, Research of any kind - is a Positive Black Swan business. All you need is one radical breakthrough from somewhere and you’re all set. Every single other line of inquiry could turn up empty but if just one succeeds, it’s game on. Once somebody knows the answer, everybody else will come to hear of it too and then we can start testing it more thoroughly, applying it in various ways and so on.</p>
<p>So, if you’re betting that Science won’t really make too much of a change in the coming years, then you need every piece of research in every single direction to fail.</p>
<p>I dunno how sound this argument is.</p>
<h1 id="the-outside-the-box-solution">The Outside the Box solution</h1>
<p>PG <a href>suggests</a> that if you want to beat Microsoft, you don’t do it by building a better OS for desktops and eroding their market share. You probably do it by making desktop OSes obsolete. (see: Google). Make them irrelevant, instead of mounting a frontal attack.</p>
<p>Similarly, if we say that current techniques of Science are not good enough to solve our problems with our given constraints, then maybe the way ahead isn’t to build slightly better scientific techniques. Maybe the way is to make scientific techniques obsolete or irrelevant. Bring out some revolutionary problem-solving techniques.</p>
<p>How could you do that? I dunno. I don’t want to be too optimistic. That would be repeating the Science-Fantasy problem, getting your hopes too high thinking your techniques are epic when there isn’t commensurate real-world evidence of awesomeness.</p>

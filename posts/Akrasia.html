<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: Why aren’t we taking action?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="the-million-dollar-question">The million-dollar question</h1>
<p>This is a fundamental problem I’ve kept coming up against for years now.</p>
<p>You’ve been living your life for quite a while now. It’s probably not too bad, but not too great either. You want to take your life to “the next level”. You have some actions you know you need to do level up.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Physical fitness</p>
<p>You know you need to follow a healthy diet and exercise regularly and stuff. It’s a pretty well-established fact.</p></li>
<li><p>Idea generation</p>
<p>You know you need to write lots of essays and take action on them and stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>Sleeping well</p>
<p>You know you need to go to bed at a sane time and sleep for at least 8 hours everyday.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating an awesome Impact in your life</p>
<p>You know you need to take a lot of Action on the different ideas you have come across.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Cool. That’s what you know.</p>
<p>What you also know is that you’re currently <strong>not</strong> doing any of those things.</p>
<p>Cool. No problem. So, you’ve got to get from here to there.</p>
<p>The question is <strong>how</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="bullcrap-and-akrasia">Bullcrap and Akrasia</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“Dude! That’s such a dumb question. You know what you need to do. Just go ahead and do it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s get the obvious bullcrap out of the way. We know that No Impact, No Right to Talk.</p>
<p>How long have you known about these actions that you need to do? Did you come across them just two hours ago?</p>
<p>Nope. We’ve all known for quite a while what we need to do.</p>
<p>Anyway, we’ve known for years by now (part of) what we should be doing for a better life. And, despite our best intentions, we haven’t been doing it. It’s not like we were really busy doing some other awesome stuff or something. We just didn’t do it. There are really no excuses.</p>
<p>This is what we call in the business “Akrasia”. Weakness of will. Acting against your better judgement (thank you, Wikipedia).</p>
<h1 id="butt">Butt</h1>
<p>Ok. We’ve now got a Greek name for the thing. What’s changed?</p>
<p>I hope we are in agreement that there is stuff that we aren’t getting done at all. I could have avoided eating those pastries in the evening. I could have exercised everyday for the past month. I could have written essays everyday for the last month (<a href="../archive.html">wait a minute</a> :P). I could have slept <a href="./Early-to-bed-Early-to-rise.html">earlier</a>. And taken tons of more action. Nothing was really stopping me. But I didn’t do it.</p>
<p>We haven’t really come up with anything new so far. Just a name for the thing. Big deal.</p>
<p>Wait. Think about what this means.</p>
<p>What do we do when we fail to get something done? What do we do when we see ourselves looking like a pregnant mother (-f*cker) in the mirror? What do we do when we have once again procrastinated on some activity that is crucial for our progress? What do we do when we fail to make headway on some important project at work or in our personal life?</p>
<p>We beat the crap out of ourselves. We curse ourselves for having wasted the entire weekend just watching Youtube videos and getting nothing done. We add fuel to the slowly growing fire that says that we will never be able to really accomplish anything great in life. We let our dreams retreat into the recesses of our minds and hand over the reins to the fears that say we will never make it big in the future.</p>
<p>Yeah. That’s logical, right? Akrasia is a personal disease, like cancer. We have it, nobody else does. We (and our dreams) are going to die like right now while others will go on existing and making their awesome dreams come to life. It’s our fault. We should beat ourselves up for it. Right?</p>
<p>Nah. Akrasia is like a butt. We’ve all got it. Because of it there’s a lot of shit in your life. But there’s a lot of shit in everyone’s life too. Remember that. Always.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="its-showtime">It’s Showtime!</h1>
<h4 id="why-arent-we-taking-action">Why aren’t we taking action?</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Because of lack of funding from the Central Government</p></li>
<li><p>Because of pressure from the higher authorities</p></li>
<li><p>Because the accused is a minister’s son</p></li>
<li><p>Because we have a butt</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="whats-wrong-with-just-going-ahead-and-doing-the-right-thing-tm-at-all-times">What’s wrong with just going ahead and doing The Right Thing (TM) at all times?</h4>
<p>It ain’t happening.</p>
<p>Says who?</p>
<p>Mr. D**a. (Dosa? Diva? Daga? Data?)</p>
<h4 id="what-is-the-official-term-for-weakness-of-will">What is the official term for “weakness of will”?</h4>
<p>See the title of this essay.</p>
<h4 id="what-do-we-do-when-we-fail">What do we do when we fail?</h4>
<p>We curse ourselves.</p>
<h4 id="are-we-the-only-ones-in-the-world-who-fall-prey-to-temptations">Are we the only ones in the world who fall prey to temptations?</h4>
<p>Golf champions don’t. Politicians don’t. Famous actors don’t. Young guys don’t. Young girls don’t.</p>
<p>Other people don’t feel the urge to eat tasty unhealthy food. Only we do. It’s just a coincidence that more than <a href="http://frac.org/initiatives/hunger-and-obesity/obesity-in-the-us/">68.5%</a> of US people are overweight or obese.</p>
<p>And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: Only we suck. Everybody else is living it up awesomely.</p>
<h4 id="real-moral-of-the-story-akrasia-is-like-a">Real moral of the story: Akrasia is like a</h4>
<p>***t (nut? slut? cut?)</p>
<p>Everyone has it.</p>
<p>Ain’t something specially broken about you if there is a lot of shit in your life.</p>

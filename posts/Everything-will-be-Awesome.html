<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What makes us so confident that the future of our world is going to better than the present?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="a-brave-new-world">A Brave New World</h1>
<p>Look to your left. Look to your right. Look to the Internet. What do you see?</p>
<p>Dazzling new inventions. Shiny gadgets. Awesome cars. Big, big buildings. Aeroplanes.</p>
<p>Call it a hunch, but I think the future is gonna be swimmingly good. Don’t you think so? Everything is on the rise. More malls, more movies, more music, more jobs, more fields to study, more wealth, more fun, in general. Things look snazzier - website designs look ever more pleasing, ads and movies seem sleeker than ever, and youngsters look super-fashionable. Pretty much every single article you find speaks of growth - How India is becoming better, or “Top 10 innovations that will transform the world in 2015”, or other giddy futuristic material.</p>
<p>The Internet is gonna make everything available to us. Gadgets, and clothes, and groceries right at our doorstep. All our friends and family right here on our smartphone, no matter how far away they are. New startups emerging from the woodwork every few months - better online payment methods, more discreet social networks, more cloud-y applications - everything is looking up. Everywhere you look, you <a href>find evidence</a> of ever-increasing awesomeness.</p>
<p>Every day and in every way, the world is getting better.</p>
<h1 id="growth-and-decline">Growth and Decline</h1>
<p>I’m 24 now and, so far, my life story has been all about growth. Physical growth, mental growth, emotional growth, and whatnot. Every single part of life I care about has been becoming more abundant. I have more physical power than before (more belly fat, too, sadly). I can solve problems much better now. I have more money than I had before. I can eat whatever I want at any restaurant I want, no holds barred. Nobody to stop me from buying books or junk food or whatever. I can stay up as long as I want. I can watch whatever movies I want. I can work on the computer as long as I want.</p>
<p>Life has been becoming peachier and peachier. It’s all been about increase. Better jobs. Better grades. Better institutions of learning. Smarter friends. <a href>Funnier</a> TV shows. <a href>More captivating</a> TV shows. <a href>More enchanting</a> TV shows. It’s always getting better. Movie makers are trying to outdo themselves with every new movie. As are music artists. Ditto for writers, online or elsewhere. Budgets are getting bigger, movie stars are getting more ripped, actresses are getting hotter. Records are being broken left and right in sports or in movies. Programming languages are getting awesome-r and awesome-r.</p>
<p>I’ve pretty much never experienced decrease, is what I’m trying to say.</p>
<h1 id="optimism-bias">Optimism Bias</h1>
<p>However, I’m not alone in this. In fact, my hypothesis was that it was only naive youngsters like me who were overly optimistic about the future, on account of our lack of worldly experience. But it turns out that older people aren’t any better at this either.</p>
<p>Wikipedia says this is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias">Optimism Bias</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The optimism bias (also known as unrealistic or comparative optimism) is a bias that causes a person to believe that they are less at risk of experiencing a negative event compared to others.</p>
<p>– <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m gonna interpret that as saying that we don’t really expect to have negative things happen to us in the future. And since a decline in fortune or a reduction in lifestyle is a negative event, we will think it won’t really happen to us. That is, we think that the future will either continue to be this good or become better.</p>
<p>So what? The future <em>is</em> going to be better. What’s wrong with feeling hopeful about the truth?</p>
<h1 id="i-missed-a-life-lesson">I missed a life lesson</h1>
<p>I was a student during the Recession of 2007-09. I only graduated after the whole thing had kinda settled down and things were looking good again.</p>
<p>So, I never really got what was so awful about the Recession. I mean, sure, people kept saying stuff about the subprime mortgage crisis and about this and that. And how Greece and Turkey were screwed up. And all that.</p>
<p>But it didn’t feel real to me.</p>
<p>I never faced uncertain job prospects. I didn’t feel how it was to go out and find half your savings wiped out cos the market had gone down.</p>
<p>Why is that a problem? Well, I might make the wrong conclusions from my selective experience. Having never suffered through a major crisis personally, like a world war, or a financial crisis after I became an adult, or some major natural calamity, or even some acute shortages like water shortage or whatever, I might think that things are always going to be this way.</p>
<p>The worst part is that even when people have been through a crisis, as most of the world did a few years ago, they still <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias#Attempts_to_alter_and_eliminate">don’t learn</a>.</p>
<p>Our situation may be more precarious than we realize. And our unfettered optimism may make our future even worse. We may fail to see the warning signs before the anvil drops on our head.</p>
<h1 id="being-joker-is-easier-than-being-batman">Being Joker is easier than being Batman</h1>
<p>People think that because the two are at a stalemate, they are equally powerful, like two people in a tug-of-war.</p>
<p>And since Batman is a billionaire and stuff and Joker came from nothing, people <a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-5-ugly-lessons-hiding-in-every-superhero-movie_p2/">argue</a> that we should give more respect to Joker. He has done more work and deserves more credit.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>It is true that their powers are roughly cancelling out each other. Neither is winning really big, neither is losing really big. But that doesn’t mean that they have equal potential.</p>
<p>It takes much, much less effort to destroy things than it does to build them. I believe the Second Law of Thermodynamics enters the picture somewhere. If your notion of “progress” is simply to <em>destroy</em> whatever progress other people have made and to create chaos, then Nature is on your side. You have her enormous force behind you. If you can lose a bit of your ethics, being an Agent of Chaos really isn’t all that hard.</p>
<p>Destruction is much easier than Construction. One consequence of this is that you can lose the fruits of a lifetime in a flash. Markets collapse, shit happens, boom.</p>
<p>I don’t think we humans can wrap our heads around this cold fact very easily.</p>
<h1 id="the-hope-hypothesis">The Hope Hypothesis</h1>
<p>Think of everything that you implicitly expect from the future. Stuff that is so obvious that it is not even worth saying out loud. I mean, <em>of course</em> we expect to live for at least another 50 years. <em>Of course</em> we expect to have more wealth in the future. <em>Of course</em> we expect to set up a nice family and raise kids and have everything go successfully. It’s all part of the plan.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I expect to increase my skills in some important area of life with every passing month. I become pretty sad when I feel I haven’t.</p></li>
<li><p>I expect to make more money with every passing year (or, at least, maintain my income).</p></li>
<li><p>I expect to live in bigger houses.</p></li>
<li><p>I expect to have better phones - Can you imagine downshifting to a normal phone after you’ve used a smartphone for a while?</p></li>
<li><p>I expect to have better girlfriends over time.</p></li>
<li><p>I expect to have more fun with each year.</p></li>
<li><p>I expect to become fitter and stronger with every year.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-perils-of-optimism">The Perils of Optimism</h1>
<p>It’s really hard to make a lot of progress. But, all the messages around us tell us that it is possible. Yes We Can! So, not only do we believe that it is really important to make a lot of progress, we also believe that we can!</p>
<p>And then we face the real world. Shit is difficult.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is probably as unlikely that you will now become as rich and famous as Bill Gates as it was unlikely in the seventeenth century that you would succeed to the ranks of the French aristocracy.</p>
<p>But the point is, it doesn’t feel that way. It is made to feel, by magazines and other media outlets, that if you put energy and a few bright ideas about technology and a garage, you too could start a major thing.</p>
<p>– Alain de Botton</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine the pressure we put on ourselves. Everything should keep getting better. If it doesn’t, we suck. That’s the second part of the two-punch whammy of Blind Faith in Progress - Personal Responsibility.</p>
<p>First, you expect a lot from yourself. And then, you take it personally. If you succeed, it was because <em>you</em> made it happen! Yay! And if you fail, you’re a loser. You can’t even do this right? What’s wrong with you? It’s bad enough that we didn’t get what we wanted, but we end up feeling like a low-life loser because of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Our] tendency to set <em>unrealistic goals</em>, may be the cause of much of the current depression epidemic in the United States. We set extreme goals: fame, fortune, glory, and supersized personal achievements. <em>We’re encouraged</em>, says Nesse, <em>to believe that we can do anything we set our hearts to</em>, and then we try to achieve dreams that are just unrealistic.</p>
<p>– Reality is Broken, Jane McGonigal (emphasis mine)</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="so-what-if-you-fail">So what if you fail?</h1>
<p>For example, I expect my essays to keep getting better. Else, I’m a loser.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Why, though?” said I, like Harry asking that soothing voice when under the Imperius curse. “Why should they keep improving?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Seriously, what will happen if I write an essay that is crappier than usual? What if my earnings keep decreasing with every passing year? Will the sky fall down on my head?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sort of thing seems unthinkable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It <em>has</em> to keep improving”, my mind says. “Make it happen!”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Otherwise, what?” I ask.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“No! It’ll be a <em>very</em> bad thing. We can’t allow it to happen.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What really will happen if the world becomes worse? Isn’t this putting a lot of pressure on us? Why can’t we just chill and do whatever we want to? Isn’t this Optimism a huge burden? Don’t you already feel a strange lightness in your heart as you contemplate just shedding that huge load and living life freely?</p>
<p>It seems like a question of Expectations. It is because we have such high Expectations (of ourselves and of others) that we need to run like mad on this treadmill of life. If we can just adjust our Expectations, wouldn’t that make life a lot better?</p>
<p>Our expectations are so high that, hey:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only thing you can’t have these days is have an experience that exceeds your expectations.</p>
<p>– Barry Schwarz, author of the Paradox of Choice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it isn’t a radical thought. People used to have low expectations before. <em>Everyone</em> used to be like that in the pre-Renaissance period. Apparently, this whole wide-eyed hope about the future is a product of our modern times (starting from the Enlightenment Age, to be precise).</p>
<hr />
<p>Is that justified? How much hope should we really have about the future?</p>
<p>What would it take to convince us that our hope is misplaced?</p>
<p>How does that even matter, though? It doesn’t affect our decisions in any way, does it?</p>
<p>(to be continued)</p>

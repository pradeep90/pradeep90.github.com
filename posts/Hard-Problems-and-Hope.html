<p><strong>Entry Question</strong>: Why do I feel zero hope when trying to solve Hard Problems?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="where-does-confusion-reside">Where does Confusion reside?</h1>
<p>The main reason I feel no hope about solving a Hard Problem is that I feel utterly <em>confused</em> about it. It seems to me like I have no clue how to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Well… <strong>Flash News</strong>: Confusion exists in the Map, not in the Territory.</p>
<p>When you are confused about a problem, it is a statement about your mind, not about the problem. The <em>problem</em> is not confusing! <em>You</em> are confused about the problem.</p>
<p>Our mind thinks by using symbols to represent things. It manipulates the symbols, not the things themselves. Which means that there is a chance of the symbol representing something other than what it should represent. It’s like having a map of some territory. While drawing the map of some country, you can draw a mountain in the wrong place. That doesn’t mean that the mountain has shifted location. It’s just that your map is wrong. It does not correspond to the territory anymore.</p>
<p>Similarly, if I draw a lake in some place, it doesn’t mean there is actually a lake out there. My map is wrong. I need to go over there and check out what really exists.</p>
<p>Most importantly, if there is a blank spot in my <em>map</em>, doesn’t mean there is a blank spot in the <em>territory</em>. My map is incomplete.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ok. Fine. So what?</p>
<p>Well, it’s the same problem when I’m feeling all <em>demotivated</em> about hard problems. My mind - my map of the problem - has a blank spot where the solution should be. There is nothing there. It seems like the problem has no solution. When I ask my mind, “What is the solution to this problem?”, it returns null. No solution. So, I become depressed.</p>
<p>But… The Map is not the Territory. There is a solution out there, you just don’t know it yet. Your Map is out of sync.</p>
<h1 id="naive-realism">Naive Realism</h1>
<p>Naive Realism is when you think that your Map represents the Territory exactly. So, if it <em>seems</em> to you that there is no solution, then there <em>is</em> no solution in reality. Naturally, this is wrong.</p>
<p>Seems blindingly obvious, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>Really? Then, why was I despairing about how all my problems were just too much for me to handle? Why do people feel so depressed and frustrated about their problems?</p>
<p>I was depressed and frustrated because, in my Map, there was no solution. So, I thought that, in Reality too, there was no solution at all. No wonder I was despairing.</p>
<p>I think this is the most common failure mode when facing Hard Problems (or any problem you can’t solve, really). Our problems <em>look</em> really, really hard and really, really unsolvable, and so we just drown in despair.</p>
<p>Not cool. We won’t make this mistake again. We won’t lose hope so easily.</p>
<h1 id="should-we-let-confusion-make-us-depressed">Should we let Confusion make us depressed?</h1>
<p>I get depressed cos I feel the problem is too hard for me to solve. Why am I so sure that the problem is too difficult for me? Cos I ask my mind for a solution and it gives me none. But that doesn’t mean there is no solution out there that I can find.</p>
<p>Look at it from a Bayesian perspective: For problems that I have no idea of how to solve, is my confusion <em>evidence</em> that I can’t solve the problem?</p>
<p>Well, what are the hypotheses? One, the problem really is too difficult for me - I won’t solve it no matter how hard I try. Two, the problem isn’t too difficult - I will get to the solution with a little more effort and time. Three, the problem is only moderately difficult - I will get to the solution with quite a bit of effort and time. And so on, for different gradations of difficulty.</p>
<p>Do they differ in their likelihood when talking about confusion? In each of those cases, when I try to think of solutions to the problem right now, what will my mind come up with?</p>
<p>First hypothesis: my mind will be confused. It won’t return any answer.</p>
<p>Second hypothesis: my mind will be confused. It won’t return any answer.</p>
<p>Third hypothesis: my mind will be confused. It won’t return any answer.</p>
<p>… and so on.</p>
<p>In all of these cases, we will get the same outcome - confusion. They all have the same likelihood for confusion. All problems look confusing till we solve them.</p>
<p>Which means that confusion is <em>not</em> evidence for or against any of these hypotheses. It doesn’t give us any new information. So, we should <em>not</em> become any more frustrated or depressed when we get confused. It must not affect our estimation of how likely we are to succeed.</p>
<p>(Note: The hypothesis that the problem is easy and obvious to solve is falsified cos I haven’t got the solution and am confused.)</p>
<h1 id="do-big-confusions-need-big-solutions">Do Big Confusions need Big Solutions?</h1>
<p>The takeaway lesson here is that confusion about a problem <em>does not</em> mean that you can’t solve it. You may solve it ten years from now. Or you may solve it day after tomorrow. Either is possible.</p>
<p>More importantly, just because you have a <em>lot</em> of confusion in your mind about a problem doesn’t mean you will take a <em>lot</em> of time and effort to solve it.</p>
<p>A tiny little insight could do the trick. Or ten. The point is you don’t know. It seems to you right now that you would need a minimum of 257 ideas to solve this big problem. Nope. Needn’t be so. You’re not justified in assuming that it’s gonna take tons of insights.</p>
<p>The size of your confusion needn’t correlate at all with the size of the solution. The size and complexity of the solution depends on the actual problem and its details (the territory), not how big your confusion is (the map). Right now, it’s a black box to you. You have no idea about its underlying causal structure. Doesn’t mean the causal structure will be super-complex. It could be a simple idea. You don’t know until you collect information and deduce its inner workings.</p>
<p>So, don’t get super-depressed and demotivated if you have a Huge Confusion in your head. The solution might be simple and easily available after all. Judge the problem based on its actual details, not on how it seems to you in your mind.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Ok. Now that we know about Naive Realism and Map != Territory, we realize that Confusion should not make us lose any hope. Also, Big Confusions may be cleared even with a small insight. No need to get all angsty and depressed about it, SPK. Keep working on the hard problems.</p>
<p>That was about <em>not</em> losing hope unnecessarily. What do we do to actually increase our chances of succeeding? Coming soon.</p>

<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>Complementary resources and unfinished ideas.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I learnt the whole idea of Map and Territory and Confusion from <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Map_and_Territory_(sequence)">Eliezer</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s (not) magic!</p>
<p>Don’t give up easily. Keep at it. The confusion is in your head. Don’t treat the problem itself as though it <em>is</em> confusing. It is perfectly ordinary and works precisely according to the laws of physics and stuff. There is some rhythm behind the madness. It’s not magic.</p>
<p>Treat it like an ordinary, everyday concept. Because it is. Treat it just like you would every other concept that is clear to you. There is nothing different about this one. When you’re finished with it, it will seem just as ordinary and understandable and plain and non-magical as the other stuff in your life. You will be able to see what’s happening from start to finish. You will be able to predict what’s gonna happen next every step along the way. Just like how dropping a ball makes it go to the ground with an acceleration of g. You know exactly how it’s gonna turn out. No mystery. No magic.</p>
<p>[Matrix Quote about seeing what’s gonna happen next - determinism]</p>
<p>Most important of all, ignore the crap signals your mind is giving you about how f*cking difficult and confusing this problem is.</p></li>

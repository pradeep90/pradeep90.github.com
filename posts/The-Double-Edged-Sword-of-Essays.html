            <h1>The Double-Edged Swords of Essays</h1>

            <p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What the f*ck was I on about <a href="./Portrait-of-the-Writer-as-an-Ignorant-Fool.html">yesterday</a>? How could writing essays possibly be dangerous?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="caution">Caution</h2>
<p>Writing an essay will make your ideas solid and real. You will really <em>get</em> the idea when you write a full essay about it. You will understand the shit out of it when you write about it from different angles and stuff.</p>
<p>What’s not to like?</p>
<p>You will feel you have understood the idea.</p>
<p>Wait a minute!</p>
<p>When do we allow somebody to say that he has “understood” an idea?</p>
<p>When they get awesome results from it. Nothing more, nothing less. Until then, they should just Shut the F*ck Up and Simply Take Action.</p>
<p>That is the danger of writing an essay. It fools your mind. You get convinced that you have done what you need to do. But you have done nothing at all. An idea without action is like a car without petrol. Ain’t going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
<h2 id="a-personal-example">A personal example</h2>
<p>Think about an essay you’ve written about some topic important to you.</p>
<p>I wrote an essay on Sunk Costs two years ago. I rather like it. It’s pretty well-structured according to my standards. Lots of pics, lots of examples, it’s funny too. I gained a lot of understanding from that essay.</p>
<p>So what?</p>
<p>Have I gone into all the areas of my life and rooted out every last trace of the Sunk Cost Fallacy? Forget that. Have I at least ignored more Sunk Costs than the next guy? If not… <a href="./Who-should-you-respect.html">you know what I’m gonna say</a>.</p>
<p>I haven’t! Hence, I have a lot of work left ahead of me in that department. However, it doesn’t <em>feel</em> that way! It feels like I “understand” the idea just fine.</p>
<p>Noooooooooo!!!!!</p>
<p>Did you feel you understood the idea when you wrote about it? Did it feel like you’ve got that part of your life handled? Cool. How much did your life change?</p>
<h2 id="what-can-we-do-to-counter-this">What can we do to counter this?</h2>
<p>Remember, <a href="./Regret-without-Action.html">No Regret without Action</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the problem more closely. Our mind confuses writing essays about an idea with actually achieving a big Impact in that field. We need some way to Keep it Real.</p>
<p>Why not stop writing at all? Can’t. Too many benefits. <a href="./Why-write-Blog-posts.html">Like</a> <a href="./The-Great-300-Word-Experiment.html">what</a>? Clarifying ideas and generating new ones. Improving other people’s lives.</p>
<p>Why not just keep writing and stop if you notice that it’s fooling you into thinking you have achieved stuff when you haven’t? Ain’t gonna work. <em>Everyone</em> is fooled <em>all the time</em>. It slips under the radar.</p>
<p>What kind of essays trigger this problem? Has it got to do with <a href="./Portrait-of-the-Writer-as-an-Ignorant-Fool.html">the difference</a> between the boring straight-from-the-textbook prof and the cool do-research-as-part-of-the-class prof? Why is the first one stuck in a dead-end while the other one is flourishing? What is the difference between teaching and <em>being</em> a teacher? Could it be the <strong>authoritativeness</strong> that creeps in? Does the very fact of identifying yourself as a “teacher” make you think “I understand this idea really well”?</p>
<p>Our mind thinks “I understand this idea really well” implies “I’m obviously gonna get awesome results in this field”. Why isn’t that true? If you understand something really well, shouldn’t you rock it in that field? Where is the flaw in our logic?</p>
<p>Well, when our mind says “I understand this …” what it really means is “It <em>feels</em> like I understand this …”. Can you see which part throws the spanner in the works?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Yes. Got it! No more feelings! Death to feelings! Feelings are Irrational!!!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really understanding something is not the only way to make you <em>feel</em> you understand it. How else? Perhaps another look at the first paragraph of this essay.</p>
<p>What else is wrong with our mind’s equation? What can come in the way of converting utter understanding into superb success? A million and one things. More on this later.</p>
<h2 id="checklist-for-writing-safely">Checklist for Writing safely</h2>
<p>So, after considering the problem requirements in detail, what are our current solutions?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Don’t identify yourself as a “teacher”. <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html">Keep your Identity Small</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t write with Authority, like you’ve figured it all out. (Unless you’ve actually got the results to back it up)</p>
<p>In particular, resist writing <strong>complete</strong> one-stop-shop essays that “explain” an idea fully. Keep it open-ended. Cos it is.</p></li>
<li><p>Write primarily to generate new ideas for yourself.</p>
<p>Demand improvements that apply to <em>your</em> life, no matter how basic the essay is. “What’s in it for me?” is actually a good question here.</p></li>
<li><p>The most important Action: Keep it Real</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Think of a <strong>test</strong> that will force you to be honest about whether you’re actually making an Impact or just mentally masturbating.</p>
<p>Example: If some <a href="../">blog writer</a> claims that it is insanely useful to write a lot of essays, the obvious test is - see if aforementioned writer is actually <a href="../archive.html">writing a lot of essays</a>. Otherwise, he has no right to talk about the topic.</p></li>
</ul>

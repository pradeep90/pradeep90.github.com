<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: Why don’t I hit the sack early?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-happens-every-night">What happens every night?</h2>
<p>Get back from work at around 8:30pm.</p>
<p>Have dinner.</p>
<p>Something something something…</p>
<p>It’s 3am in the morning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>F*ck! F*ck! F*ck!</p>
<p>I need to go to bed soon.</p>
<p>Damn! I screwed it up even today. Now, I’ll wake up late tomorrow and thus go to work late and thus come back home late and thus go to sleep late tomorrow and thus wake up even later and thus…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe this is what they call a vicious cycle.</p>
<h2 id="the-show-must-go-on">The Show must go on</h2>
<p>The point is - I don’t <em>feel</em> like going to bed.</p>
<p>I want to keep <em>doing</em> something. Maybe read some blog posts on my laptop. Maybe watch some videos on Youtube. Maybe read some book in bed. Maybe watch a movie. Something or the other.</p>
<p>My mind just doesn’t want to rest. It doesn’t want to be shut down.</p>
<p>I want the night to keep going on as long as possible. I never want it to end.</p>
<p>Why this kolaveri?</p>
<p>I seriously don’t know. Let’s find out.</p>
<h2 id="going-to-bed-is-boring">Going to bed is boring</h2>
<p>I want the stimulation to keep coming at night.</p>
<p>Well, what happens if I don’t go and read some book? What happens if I don’t watch some Youtube videos? What does it feel like?</p>
<p>I feel anxious. I feel like I’m losing out on something.</p>
<p>It’s how you feel when all your friends have gone on some tour or outing and you’re sitting at home about to go to bed. Holy crap. You are missing out on the whole party. You’re missing out on all the fun. There they are, doing all kinds of awesome stuff, having the time of their lives, flush full of excitement and joy. Their night has just begun. And here <em>you</em> are, turning off the TV, shutting down your computer, turning off the lights, and pulling the blanket over yourself.</p>
<p>Not only is it boring in itself, it is 20x more boring now that you can see all the other exciting stuff you’re missing out on.</p>
<p>Hmmm… So <strong>that’s</strong> it! That is why I feel like never going to bed. I feel like I’m missing out on the excitement I could have by entertaining myself a bit more.</p>
<h2 id="staying-up-late-is-cool">Staying up late is Cool</h2>
<p>What goes through my mind when I think of sleeping at some ungodly hour like 11pm?</p>
<p>First, who goes to bed so early? Kids and Uncles and Aunties. The neighbour’s 8-year-old kid goes to bed at 10pm. My grandparents go to bed at 11pm. Hmmm… Could that have something to do with my reluctance to sleep early?</p>
<p>Second, who the f*ck wakes up at 7am in the morning (when they have the option of waking up later)? Only retirees and people who don’t have anything better to do than sit up and read a newspaper till 8am. What will I do at 7am in the morning? I haven’t woken up at 7am in the morning for years now, unless there’s been an 8am class I need to get to.</p>
<p>Third, the metaphorical party starts at 11pm, dude! That’s when all the cool guys have parties and stuff. That’s when all the great hackers get their most productive work done. Plus, all the dumb people are in bed. That makes it an even more awesome time of the day. You’re part of a self-selected elite. Only people with the appropriate street cred are awake late at night. You know, young students working on their assignments, young lovers exchanging… text messages, cool musicians making music, young art people making art, young parents making babies… hey! You know what they say - the night is young! Not old. Not pre-pubescent. The night is young. And young is cool.</p>
<h2 id="the-night-is-magical">The Night is Magical</h2>
<p>Midnight feels completely different from the rest of the day. So, we think the normal rules of life don’t apply. It feels like that time is special. It feels like nothing bad will happen no matter what you do.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to do stupid things in broad daylight. It’s hard to ignore the reality in front of your eyes at a sober 10am. You need the seductive charm of the darkness. What happens after midnight, stays after midnight… or something like that.</p>
<p>F*ck! That’s why I do a lot of stupid things at night.</p>
<p>This means that we should treat our judgement at night the same way we would treat our judgement after we get drunk - highly suspect and prone to recommending stuff we will regret the next day.</p>
<p>Of course, in the moment, it will feel like we’re making a lot of sense. It will <em>feel</em> like we’re making a lot of progress. Drunkard’s talk.</p>
<h2 id="the-alarm-is-silent">The Alarm is silent</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If I woke up one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I’d feel like something was terribly wrong. Just thinking about it makes me wince. I’d start to feel uncomfortable after sitting on a sofa watching TV for 2 hours, let alone a whole day.</p>
<p>And yet I’ve definitely had days when I might as well have sat in front of a TV all day - days at the end of which, if I asked myself what I got done that day, the answer would have been: basically, nothing. I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as bad as I’d feel if I spent the whole day on the sofa watching TV. If I spent a whole day watching TV I’d feel like I was descending into perdition. But the same <strong>alarms don’t go off</strong> on the days when I get nothing done, because I’m doing stuff that seems, superficially, like real work.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There are no warning signals when I’m doing crap at night. It feels like the normal rules don’t apply. Anything goes. And why are there no warning signals? Cos my mind doesn’t have anybody else to contrast my behaviour with. Sure, I know there are other people and they all wake up at the crack of dawn everyday and go to work and stuff. But it doesn’t <em>feel real</em>.</p>
<p>Not in the same way as it does when I actually walk down the streets at 7am someday and see <em>every</em> single person being up and ready to face a day of work or school. <em>Then</em>, my mind starts wavering. “Whoa. I don’t think I’m being as productive as I could be.” It’s just plain obvious I can be much more productive if I stopped screwing around all night.</p>
<p>Hmmm… maybe that’s why I resist waking up early in the morning. I don’t want to face the reality of how much crap I’m doing (and how much stuff I’m <em>not</em> doing).</p>
<h2 id="the-dark-night-rises">The Dark Night rises</h2>
<p>I don’t want the party to end at night. Going to bed is boring compared to the real fun I think I’m having. Staying up late is what cool guys do. Isn’t the night full of mystery and hidden opportunity? Aren’t all the normal rules of life suspended? Isn’t time itself suspended?</p>
<p>The payoff of staying up a bit longer is vivid and real. The expected benefit of waking up early is vague and boring. The price for abusing my body is extracted a long time later in the future. The warning signals are silent. My mind is blissful and ignorant… like a drunkard.</p>
<p>Any wonder why I don’t go to bed early?</p>

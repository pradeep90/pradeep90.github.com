<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What do I mean when I say I’m “seeking approval” from someone? Am I trying to get a signature on a government project document?</p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-want-from-them">What do you want from them?</h2>
<p>We took a preliminary shot at Approval Seeking (and Jealousy) in <a href="./Road-to-Maturity-First-Steps.html">Road to Maturity: First steps</a>.</p>
<p>This is gonna be a bit of a rough post as well, cos I’m just making sense of my thoughts on this. Anyway… here goes…</p>
<hr />
<p>Have you ever tried to slip in statements about awesome stuff you’ve being doing when you’re talking to someone?</p>
<p>Have you ever dropped the names of some cool places you’ve been to just so that the other person will get impressed?</p>
<p>Have you been on Facebook recently? :P (Kidding. Right?)</p>
<h2 id="types-of-approval-seekees">Types of Approval-Seekees</h2>
<p>Who are the people from whom you want a metaphorical pat on the back and a “good job”?</p>
<p>What kinds of people can we want to like us?</p>
<p>Hmmm… for starters, let’s say your level in a certain area is around X units. It could be some vague thing like the originality of your musical compositions, or something very precise like your Chess ELO Rating.</p>
<p>How many different categories does that divide the world into?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1</p></li>
<li><p>2</p></li>
<li><p>3</p></li>
<li><p>4</p></li>
<li><p>Infinite</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>We can think of people who are at a much higher level than X - people who are way more advanced than you.</p>
<p>We can also think of people who aren’t as advanced as you - people who are at a level much lower than X.</p>
<p>Is that all?</p>
<p>(This is just a rudimentary first-shot classification. More nuanced stuff later.)</p>
<p>Think about any field you are in - music, programming, writing, whatever.</p>
<p>What sort of people do you see?</p>
<p>In music, you may have the A R Rahmans. But then, there’s also the guy who’s lugging his electric piano to class where he learns about Sa re ga ma.</p>
<p>Cool. That much is obvious. Two types so far.</p>
<p>Anything else?</p>
<p>What about you? Where do you fall? You probably aren’t yet Rahman. And if you call yourself a musician, you probably aren’t a n00b.</p>
<p>If you complain that you are not part of this classification system, what if an exact replica of you comes along? Where will you place him?</p>
<p>Hmmm… that suggests having a category of people who are more or less at the same level X.</p>
<p>Are we done?</p>
<p>What other kinds of people do you see?</p>
<p>What about your parents? Or the guy at the shop selling coconuts? Or some guy who’s a mechanic?</p>
<p>They probably aren’t even in the field. Their level is around zero.</p>
<p>Ok. So what?</p>
<h2 id="you-omg-he-said-that-about-me">You: OMG!! <strong><em>He</em></strong> said that about me?!</h2>
<p>We can easily think of the first kind of person we’re trying to impress.</p>
<p>We want him/her to think that we are an incredibly talented programmer / poet / photographer / keyboardist / basketball player / flirter.</p>
<p>We have this person who is ahead of us along the path we want to travel. And we want this person to think that we have it too.</p>
<p>It’s like being a musician and having A R Rahman listen to you play and say that you’re doing really well.</p>
<p>It’s like being a cricketer and having Sachin Tendulkar say that your straight drive is really good.</p>
<p>It’s like being a programmer and having a god programmer from Silicon Valley say that you’ve done some excellent work.</p>
<p>Hey! You’ll be walking on air for the next couple of days. You’ll probably relive those moments over and over again.</p>
<p>“[Stud Guy in my field] said I did [my field’s work] really well! Wow! He said X, Y, and Z… Yay!!!”</p>
<p>And then some more.</p>
<p>Cloud nine.</p>
<h2 id="hey-nice-work-on-that-last-project.-that-was-difficult.">“Hey, nice work on that last project. That was difficult.”</h2>
<p>Who are these guys?</p>
<p>People at about the same level as you. They could be your classmates at college or co-workers or people taking the same course at some academy.</p>
<p>Do you feel the difference between praise (or even acknowledgement) from greats and praise from your <em>peers</em>?</p>
<p>Do you hold your head a bit higher when you walk? Perhaps you jutt your chest out a bit too. Do you feel a bit proud of the work you’ve put in? Do you feel like you’ve accomplished something worthwhile?</p>
<p>Respect. Not candy from your daddy, but a badge won from your equals.</p>
<h2 id="wow-that-was-awesome.-how-did-you-play-that-riff-that-was-so-cool.">“Wow! That was awesome. How did you play that riff? That was so cool.”</h2>
<p>Introducing the Fan Club.</p>
<p>These are people who think they are a way lower level than you.</p>
<p>Yes, this will include the newbies who are just beginning to feel their way around. And they see what you’re doing (and hopefully you’re kicking some ass in that field), and they can’t believe it.</p>
<p>Cool. Happens. You probably do that when you see programmers / musicians / writers who are way more advanced than you.</p>
<p>Sadly, there’s another component here. The people who are actually pretty close to your level but don’t even realize it.</p>
<p>They think they can never do what you’re doing, even though you can see as plain as day that it’s at an arm’s stretch from them.</p>
<p>Lots more on this later.</p>
<p>What do <em>you</em> get here though?</p>
<p>Admiration. The feeling that you’re going places. Damn does it feel good to have someone tell you you’re doing everything right.</p>
<h2 id="oh-my-god-thats-fantastic.-youre-a-genius">“Oh my god! That’s fantastic. You’re a genius!”</h2>
<p>The layman.</p>
<p>As in, people who can’t make out the difference between X or X - 10 or X + 10.</p>
<p>Cool. We probably do that about every single profession with which we are unfamiliar (maybe politics, police, army, serious research scientists, fire-fighters, circus artistes, stage magicians, etc.).</p>
<p>Doesn’t mean we can’t enjoy it when it happens to us.</p>
<p>How do we feel?</p>
<p>Rockstar. Bow to me!</p>
<h2 id="the-crazy-stuff-we-do">The crazy stuff we do</h2>
<p>Ok, so you made a list of different kinds of people. Big deal. I can do that too. There’s idiots, fools, atheists, people who don’t like The Big Bang Theory, people who <em>like</em> The Big Bang Theory, …</p>
<p>Why do we want these people to like us?</p>
<p>Why do we want these people to think we’re talented in some field?</p>
<p>Have you ever done something <em>entirely</em> because it would have a good impact on this one person?</p>
<p>Have you gone far out of your way to make sure you met their standards?</p>
<p>So, is approval-seeking good or bad?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<h2 id="the-wrong-questions">The wrong questions</h2>
<p>That’s the worst kind of question to start with.</p>
<p>What else could we think about first?</p>
<p>What do we expect to gain by doing all these activities?</p>
<p>Is it praise / respect / admiration / awe (from the respective kind of Approval-Seekees mentioned above)?</p>
<p>Ok, say you got that. Now what? What does that give you?</p>
<p>That’s obvious. We already mentioned the walking on air / feeling proud of yourself / having your ego massaged / feeling like a rockstar rewards of gaining the approval of others.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What’s not to like?</p></li>
<li><p>How much do we really gain? Does it compensate us for the desperate efforts we put in?</p></li>
<li><p>What about <em>your</em> goals? You’re spending so much time and effort reaching these people’s standards. What about yours? Or are these your goals? Is getting approval and praise the end game?</p>
<p>Is that what it is “all about”[vague term][clarification needed]?</p></li>
<li><p>What could be on the other side of the coin here?</p>
<p>A scar-faced Harvey Dent, perhaps?</p>
<p>What happens when the corrupt thoughts in your mind allow the Rachel Dawes of your goals to be burnt? And take away half your face with the flames?</p>
<p>What if you lose sight of your goals and then fail to even get approval from the people you desperately want to impress?</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-non-obvious-stupid-mistakes">The non-obvious stupid mistakes</h2>
<p>These are obvious kinds of mistakes. I’m sure smart people like us aren’t making such obvious mistakes.</p>
<p>We’re making way more subtle mistakes. Hey! That’s how smart we are.</p>
<p>We spoke about the ham-fisted case where your goals were in one direction and people’s expectations of you were in another. Cool. There, we know what to do (i.e., do whatever makes people like us).</p>
<p>What about cases where your goals and people’s standards for getting impressed are more or less aligned?</p>
<p>What about thorny cases like doing altruistic work? Or standing for public office?</p>
<p>How much of it are you doing because you strongly believe it needs to be done?</p>
<p>How much of it are you doing because you like the power and prestige of being the Guy who Gives, The Hero, The Chosen One? All the glory. All the adoration. All the respect from one and all.</p>
<p>“How does it matter? Good stuff is being done, right? My motivations don’t matter.”</p>
<p>Don’t they?</p>
<p>What if the two desires (doing what’s right and doing what will impress people) coincide for ten long, glorious years? And then, suddenly diverge.</p>
<p>What then? How easy will it be to say ta-ta bye-bye to all the garlands and praise and walk the path of embers? To sit on a seat of thorns after having leaned back on a throne of finest cushions for ten years?</p>

<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What do we mean when we say we want to clarify an idea?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="fake-understanding">Fake understanding</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Not a lot of people know what it feels like to be angry, in your bones. I mean, they <em>understand</em>, … everybody <em>understands</em>, for awhile. … So after awhile they stop understanding. … I figured it out too late. You gotta learn to hide the anger, practice smiling in the mirror. It’s like putting on a mask.</p>
<p>– John Blake, Dark Knight Rises</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve <a href="./Writing-for-Others.html">already</a> <a href="./Portrait-of-the-Writer-as-an-Ignorant-Fool.html">seen</a> what it means when we say we “understand” something. We have no right to say we understand something unless we’ve got pretty good results in that field.</p>
<p>That was why I chided myself for “writing some essays on ideas I <em>understood</em> so that others could benefit”. Ain’t no such ideas (yet).</p>
<p>Yet, I had <a href="./Why-write-Blog-posts.html">suggested earlier</a> that writing essays would help clarify ideas in my mind, whether I thought I knew them well or not. Now that we “understand” what it means to “understand” (do we?), what does that suggestion mean? What does it mean to clarify an idea?</p>
<p>If you can only say you understand something when you get awesome results from it, what is the point of writing essays? What is the point of reading essays?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hey! You should write essays. It will help clarify ideas in your head.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yo! Read the previous paragraphs again.</p>
<h2 id="answers">Answers?</h2>
<p>I don’t have the answers to these questions. That’s why I’m writing this essay. So that I can <em>clarify</em> them in my head. Wait a minute! What was that?!</p>
<p>Ok. Let’s look at the problem in more detail.</p>
<p>First of all, what we care about is the results. Not how much we “understand” some idea, not how much effort we put in, not how much “potential” we have - none of that crap. <a href="./Who-should-you-respect.html">No Impact, No Right to Talk</a>. If all we care about are the results, why do anything except the actions that would lead directly to the results?</p>
<p>But that’s like asking a guy searching for the keys he dropped, “Dude! Why did you look all over the house? The keys were only in one place - the place where you finally found them - under the sofa. So much wasted effort and no result.” If he had known they were under the sofa, he wouldn’t have searched anywhere else.</p>
<h2 id="looking-for-bargains">Looking for bargains</h2>
<p>Hmmm… maybe that suggests what sort of “clarifications” we should go for. Stuff that reduces the amount of effort we have to put in to get the result we want. The knowledge that the keys are somewhere under the sofa, nowhere else.</p>
<p><strong>Aside</strong>: By effort, I really mean cost. Basically, all the resources we’re giving up in order to get the result.</p>
<p>Is that all? Do we <em>just</em> want reduction of cost?</p>
<p>Wait! What do we really looking for in the first place? Assume you know what it is you want. Then, we can safely assume that what you want is to achieve it with minimum cost. You want to be efficient - get maximum output with minimum input. That much seems to be correct from whatever I have read of Economics.</p>
<p>Hmmm… okay. So, I’m suggesting that the only ideas we should try to search for (aka write about) are those that will reduce the cost of getting to our goals. Ditto for reading about ideas. Everything else is just resources going down the drain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey! Are you saying that we shouldn’t read stuff for entertainment? F*ck you, man. I love Asterix. I don’t want to keep reading work-related books all day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh. Isn’t being entertained one of your goals? Don’t you want your life to be filled with such pleasures? Let’s be clear about it. Goals means the stuff that you really care about. Not the stuff that your boss sets for you at work (though, of course, you care about the paycheck he signs at the end of each month and so will work for that reason).</p>
<p>Whatever it is you care about, we need cost-reduction-measures (aka ideas) that will get you to your goals at lower cost. Also note that if you don’t know how to get to the goal at all, then the cost is initially the cost of giving up that precious goal. Any action that helps you reach that goal and costs less than that will be a good Idea.</p>
<p>Cool. Ok. I think we can agree about this. The only useful ideas are those that reduce the cost of our search. That’s the theory. Ain’t nobody arguing with that so far. Now for the actual bang - the applications of the theory that will give us our much-loved Impact.</p>
<h2 id="brace-yourself-for-impact">Brace yourself for Impact</h2>
<p>Let’s get some ground-rules out of the way before we dive in.</p>
<p>The actions that we are going to propose shouldn’t all be such that they explain every current human action and say that, “Oh… that one… That is actually reducing cost in [insert weird round-about way]. So… umm… uh… it is efficient. No need to change anything. These are not the droids you’re looking for. Moving on.”</p>
<p>Not every change is an improvement. But every improvement <strong>is</strong> a change.</p>
<p>We’re not here to make <em>excuses</em> for stupid stuff we’ve been doing. We’re here to fix things and make them awesome! This should suggest at least a couple of things I can change right away in my life that I was doing inefficiently before.</p>
<h2 id="ultra-obvious-application-1">Ultra-Obvious Application #1</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We shouldn’t be reading about ideas that will not improve our lives in any way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And before Asterix-man complains again - yo, you’re probably safe. You can read Asterix (highly recommended, actually).</p>
<p>What is the real target here? You tell me. Is there anything you read in the last 24 hours that isn’t actually gonna make an impact on your life in any way? Are there videos you watched that are gonna make absolutely no impact on your life?</p>
<p>For example, I have watched a couple of TED videos in the past week that aren’t probably gonna make much of an impact. I am not really gonna be able to take <em>any action</em> on them in the near future. Which means that by the time I get to the point where I should take action, they will be out of my mind. Hence, useless to watch them now.</p>
<p>More egregious examples - every single non-fiction book I have read in the last month. I’m probably not gonna take any action on them at all.</p>
<p>Yes. I hear your counter-arguments. There is the benefit of having ideas simmer in your head for a while. How do we find out exactly what the benefit is? Is there any data we have?</p>
<p>Yup. Look to the past. You have read dozens of blog posts or books or whatever online in the last few years in your life. What came of them? If the “ideas bubbling in my sub-conscious” is really a good reason for reading all those books, what Impact is there to show for it? No Impact, No Right to Talk. I can bet you a hundred dollars that you don’t even remember all the books you read, forget about the scores of posts you surfed through online. All the great ideas that we came across have slipped through the good ol’ Leaky Bucket of a mind we have.</p>
<p>Anyway, more on this later. Need to credit some people for these ideas. Later.</p>

<h2 id="ultra-obvious-application-2">Ultra-Obvious Application #2</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We shouldn’t be writing about ideas that will not improve our lives in any way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To come back to the main question we asked earlier - What does it mean to clarify our thoughts in a domain?</p>
<p>Now we should know. It means to come up with Ideas - stuff that helps achieve our goals.</p>
<p>That’s what all these last 23 essays (woohoo!) have been about. That’s what it’s gonna be about in the future. Coming up with stuff to help achieve my goals.</p>
<p>Next time I have trouble thinking about whether or not to write about something, the question is simple - Is it going to generate some Ideas? Will it help improve the quality of my life in some way?</p>
<p>If not, you absolutely do not write it.</p>
<p>Note that our goals could be stuff like connecting with our friends and family through our blog. That could be a reason for writing about our cat and stuff.</p>
<p>What if we want to write essays about some topics? And we also want to write stuff about our cat? What should we do? More on this coming soon.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="intermission">Intermission</h2>
<p>I’m sure there a lot of other Ultra-Obvious Applications of the idea we had about “Ideas”. Will take them on next time. Gotta go to bed right now.</p>
<p>Just to reiterate the points I made above:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We care only about results. Talk is cheap. Hence, “understanding” a concept is a cheap, easy thing to do. We only let ourselves say that when we get the results to back it up.</p></li>
<li><p>But then, if results are all that matter, what is the point of reading or writing essays?</p></li>
<li><p>What we want is something that will reduce the effort we put in to get to our goals. Aka reduce cost.</p></li>
<li><p>We call that an Idea. What an idea, Sirji, indeed.</p></li>
<li><p>More importantly, we don’t call <strong>anything else</strong> an Idea. Not stuff that sounds “cool” or “interesting” or whatever. It must have an Impact on our life. It must reduce the cost of reaching our goals somehow. Else, it is not an Idea.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>See ya next time.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="ps">PS</h2>
<p>Keep it Real actions from my <a href="./Writing-for-Others.html">last essay</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Was this about an idea I understood or about an idea I’m struggling with?</p>
<p>Struggling with. The fact that I don’t really understand the ideas I think I “understand” was still just hitting me after my last essays. Needed to clarify the idea of “clarifying”.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I have fun?</p>
<p>Yup.</p></li>
<li><p>Surprised by anything?</p>
<p>Yup. Made a crucial connection to Economics that was not in my original intentions.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I wrote this before writing anything.</p>

<p>Is it an Idea? Write down how this so-called Idea is gonna reduce my costs (aka improve the quality of my life).</p>

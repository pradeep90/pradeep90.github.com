<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: Why am I writing a (relatively small) post everyday? Why not write my usual long posts twice a week?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="why-write-at-all">Why write at all?</h1>
<p>Do you really understand the ideas you think you understand? Rhetorical.</p>
<p>How will you know?</p>
<p>How does one know anything?</p>
<p>By asking God, of course. Or one of the spiritual masters who have descended from that ancient divine line.</p>
<p>The rest of us also know stuff by… here it comes… actually testing it out.</p>
<p>How can you test your understanding?</p>
<p>If you have a full, rigorous technical examination, preferably with a practical component, you’re good to go. It should probably expose your weak spots in no time.</p>
<p>You know, doodh ka doodh, and paani ka paani.</p>
<p>I don’t know of any easily accessible general-purpose test that can test any concept you want.</p>
<p>Or do I?</p>
<h1 id="the-tests">The tests</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>What happens when you try to explain ideas that you think are clear in your mind?</p>
<p>Will it expose any weak spots or unclear patches (which would be a good thing)?</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>Agreed. We should all write posts about stuff we think is clear in our mind just so that we can be sure that we really understand it.</p></li>
<li><p>What happens when you try to explain ideas that you think aren’t clear at all in your mind?</p>
<p>“What’s the point of that? It’s like writing a test on some syllabus you haven’t studied at all. You’re guaranteed to fail. Waste of time.”</p>
<p>Is that all there is to it?</p>
<p>What happens when you’re struggling to explain something?</p>
<p>What happens when you desperately try to make sense of stuff that just won’t coalesce neatly in your mind?</p>
<p>What happens when you force yourself to break it down into pieces and explain every single damn piece from start to finish to a neutral reader?</p>
<p>Could that help your understanding?</p>
<p>Could it give you a feeling of progress?</p>
<p>Could it give you the confidence that you can actually uncover more of the solution and slowly unveil the curtain?</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="what-about-the-rest-of-the-time">What about the rest of the time?</h1>
<p>Cool. We’ve taken care of the case where we either think we are clear about something or think we aren’t clear about something.</p>
<p>Doesn’t that cover every possible case?</p>
<p>Does it?</p>
<p>What if that “something” isn’t even in your mind?</p>
<p>How do you go about creating solutions for things that you aren’t even aware of as problems?</p>
<p>So, you write about something (about which you either think you’re clear or think you’re not clear) and you gain more insights into that thing. You have a better understanding of how it works. You can better manipulate it to your desire (that’s why we want a better understanding, right?).</p>
<p>Could that lead to a chain of other improvements and insights?</p>
<p>Could you make some associations you had previously overlooked?</p>
<p>Could some gears fall into place and produce useful motion now?</p>
<p>Am I talking about Innovation [weasel word][citation needed]?</p>
<h1 id="why-publish-it-online">Why publish it online?</h1>
<p>Why not just write it in a file on my computer?</p>
<p>I would get all of the above benefits without taking all the effort of publishing it online. (Effort? What effort? <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll">Hakyll</a>, ftw!!)</p>
<p>So far, all the benefits were directed inward. They were aimed at fixing and creating new paths in your mind.</p>
<p>What about other minds?</p>
<p>Think of the young wide-eyed n00b thinker who could race off to ever more awesome levels of Rationality if you gave him the start-up capital of basic important thought-provoking ideas. Wouldn’t hurt that he would be inspired by the success you’re having in clarifying and generating so many insane cool ideas.</p>
<p>Heck, <em>I’m</em> the young wide-eyed n00b here who got a million dollars worth of ideas and a nuclear power plant’s worth of inspiration from others.</p>
<h1 id="leaky-buckets">Leaky buckets</h1>
<p>Who else is gonna read your posts (apart from your mom and the aforementioned young wide-eyed n00b)?</p>
<p>What could leaky buckets refer to?</p>
<p>How many awesome ideas have you come across in the last 5 years of your existence?</p>
<p>At least a couple dozen, I’m willing to wager.</p>
<p>Can you even list them all? Would you be surprised if you missed a few?</p>
<p>Isn’t it a crime to effing forget a great idea that will make your life better?</p>
<p>How could you avert that crime and save Gotham City?</p>
<p>How could you make sure you are constantly reminded, in front of your eyes, of all the awesome ideas you have come across and more?</p>
<p>Yup. You got it.</p>
<h1 id="why-try-to-present-it-well">Why try to present it well?</h1>
<p>Left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<h1 id="potential-pitfalls">Potential Pitfalls</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Trying to seek praise and approval from others</p>
<p>Why is that a bad thing?</p>
<p>Won’t it make me want to <em>improve</em> my writing so that I can keep that <em>praise</em> coming?</p>
<p>Isn’t that a good thing?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Isn’t that a bad thing?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Are we making a mistake by talking in absolutes (“good” and “bad”)?</p>
<p>How else can we quantify it?</p>
<p>Costs and Benefits, anybody?</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="a-personal-note">A personal note</h1>
<p>(Skip this if you aren’t even slightly sold on writing posts yourself. And get off my site :P)</p>
<p>In case you’re wondering where this post falls for me, every single one of the ideas above came to me completely as I was writing this post.</p>
<p>The whole categorization of ideas and stuff. All the questions. Everything.</p>
<p>Sure, they’re rough and the product of only about 45 minutes of thought and writing. But if you think they were worth something, if you think they provoked you to think about the whole idea of writing, then consider it yet another success of Writing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If</strong> you can explain an idea and keep your clarity,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Or struggle with one - but keep the hilarity,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If</strong> neither easy nor hard problems can faze you,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If</strong> all ideas count with you, but none too much.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If</strong> you can fill the unforgiving blank screen</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>with thirty minutes’ worth of hard thought,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your is the Earth and everything in it,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And - which is more - you’ll be a Rational thinker, my reader!</p>
<p>– If…Else, Rational Kipling</p>

<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: TODO</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Disclaimer</strong>: This is a really experimental essay. My opinions on this can shift wildly with time (they just went 180 degrees last night at 4:30am). So, take it with a grain of salt and try to question the ideas objectively (instead of just shaking your head and saying, “What a dumbass!”).</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="central-question-how-much-hope-should-we-have-about-the-future">Central Question: How much hope should we have about the future?</h1>
<h1 id="what-is-all-this-about">What is all this about?</h1>
<p>It’s about Hope. The quintessential human emotion, as Agent Smith said.</p>
<p>How much hope should we hold out for the future?</p>
<p>Peter Thiel <a href>points out</a> that pretty much all the bubbles in recent times have involved over-optimism about how much impact certain stuff will have. Maybe that’s true of all bubbles, I don’t know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give me some concrete examples, SPK.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take education, for example.</p>
<h1 id="how-much-has-life-improved">How much has life improved?</h1>
<p>The last twenty years have been those of dizzying change. People keep reminding us what awesome times we live in.</p>
<p>Well, how awesome really are these times?</p>
<p>What has changed?</p>
<p>Our criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Happiness</li>
<li>Wealth</li>
<li>Life Expectancy</li>
<li>Better still, QUALYs (Quality-Adjusted Life Years) or, at least, Years of Healthy Life</li>
</ul>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>If wealth is not increasing, people will argue that maybe we’re happier and that makes up for the lack of wealth. Cool, so happiness is on the list too. Health is Wealth, some might say, and that’s on the list too.</p>
<p>TODO</p>
<h1 id="dangerous-expectations-why-this-matters">Dangerous Expectations: Why this matters</h1>
<p>Cos we’re making plans for the future. And if those plans are based on outdated or just plain wrong assumptions, we are screwed.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>Going for higher education and taking on large loans.</p>
<p>Marrying and starting a family.</p>
<p>Having kids.</p>
<p>Buying a house.</p>
<hr />
<p>Implicit in all that is the assumption that things will get better (or, at least, not worse). You will be able to earn huge amounts of money that will more than make up for the loans you took. The economy won’t tank. You won’t lose your job. Your skills will not become worthless. Or even if they do, you’ll somehow be able to master new skills even though you would be middle-aged and hoary and busy with a family and completely out of touch with the rigours of learning, unlike the hoards of people fresh out of college.</p>
<p>We expect that life will keep getting better or, at least, not become worse.</p>
<p>Which means that if it gets worse, we will be disappointed. And angry. And frustrated. And completely blindsided. We won’t know what hit us. We will be lost. We wouldn’t have planned for it at all, and you know what happens when you fail to plan.</p>
<h1 id="why-does-this-matter-cos-there-are-important-decisions-that-we-take-right-now-based-on-our-view-about-the-future.-examples---real-and-hypothetical-good-future-bad-future.">Why does this matter? Cos there are important decisions that we take right now based on our view about the future. Examples - real and hypothetical; good future, bad future.</h1>
<h1 id="your-standard-of-living-is-determined-by-your-level-of-productivity">Your Standard of Living is determined by your level of Productivity</h1>
<p>That’s a Principle of Economics, btw. Straight from the Mankiw textbook (which is called Principles of Economics, oddly enough).</p>
<p>In a free market economy, your productivity level determines the amount of money you make. And the amount of money you have determines your standard of living.</p>
<p>This is basically what PG is saying, in other words - Make something people want. Making something people want is about creating something that is of value to others. Something they’ll pay you for.</p>
<p>The more you create value - the more you make things people want - the more money you have. Your productivity level is nothing but the amount of value you create.</p>
<p>So, in one sense, asking if we will make progress as a society is asking whether we will be able to become more productive.</p>
<h1 id="what-are-the-limits-on-our-productivity-levels">What are the limits on our Productivity levels?</h1>
<p>Raw material. There’s only so much land. There’s only so much drinkable water (right now). Only so much usable coal, petroleum, iron, copper, and whatnot.</p>
<p>There’s limits on the population. People need food and water. They also need shelter from the elements.</p>
<p>So, first off, energy is a huge limitation. If our engines aren’t gonna become orders of magnitude more efficient soon and if the amount of fuel we have is limited, then you can’t do too much with it. You cannot go on living like this forever (with current technology).</p>
<p>And you definitely can’t keep increasing your resource demands each year. That’s just adding… ahem… fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>There’s a hard limit right there. I believe there’s a notion of Peak Oil, a point of time after which the yearly production of oil will just keep going down. You can’t increase the amount of oil production after that.</p>
<p>This would suggest that, at our current rate of consumption and with our current technology, we can’t sustain this lifestyle for too long.</p>
<p>But we believe that not only can we go on living well, we can actually improve our lifestyle.</p>
<p>Which means that we believe there will be significant technological breakthroughs that will get rid of those energy limitations.</p>
<h1 id="the-price-will-be-right">The Price will be Right</h1>
<p>Note that a common mistake people make regarding Peak Oil is that they think it is some significant omen about our oil usage.</p>
<p>People (including me) sometimes think that we will keep using oil as we do currently and then, one day, we will find that the pipe is empty. No more oil! OMG! What will we do? Our cars will halt in the middle of the road, nothing will run, civilization will grind to a stop, and all of that.</p>
<p>Well, there’s a simple mistake there - you’re not take prices into consideration. Oil is bought and sold within a market. So, when the supply of oil is tighter than the demand, what do you think will happen? Yup. The price will rise. If one litre of petrol costs Rs 70 today, it may cost Rs 200 sometime when there is a crunch.</p>
<p>And what does that do? Prices provide both Information and Incentives (thank you, <a href>Tim Harford</a>). Not only do they tell us that it will cost us Rs 200 to obtain a litre of petrol (i.e., oil is not as available as before), they ask us to either change our behaviour or pay the price.</p>
<p>So, we may decide that, at the higher rate of petrol, it’s not worth driving to some supermarket nearby. We might walk, instead. Or ride a bicycle. Or take the bus. We might reduce the number of trips we take. And so on.</p>
<p>Plus, it’s not just about the direct usage of petrol. The scarcity of petrol will propagate throughout the economy. So, vegetable prices will rise cos it’s costlier to transport them. Ditto for other things that depend on transportation. People will reduce their commute by living closer to the companies or making the company move closer to them or by working from home. Whatever. Markets don’t tell you how you should do it, they just tell you the price. You decide the best way for you based on that information.</p>
<p>So, no, it won’t come to the point where we suddenly realize that we have run out of oil. As the supply keeps decreasing, the prices will keep rising.</p>
<p>If you choose to pay that high price and still use petrol, it is safe to assume that whatever you’re using it for is worth more to you than the money you paid.</p>
<p>Remember, People face Tradeoffs (Principle #3). Sure, there is a scarcity of petrol. And it is important that we conserve it. But, there are other things important to us too. We need oil for heating homes, transporting important stuff, running the factories that produce our goods, and so on.</p>
<p>So, the economic argument is that if oil really were super-scarce, its price would reflect that. It would become costlier. But it isn’t too costly right now. So, maybe it really isn’t as scarce as it seems.</p>
<p>Note that if we keep using oil the way we do, it will become scarcer, because there is a finite amount of oil that you can extract from the earth. So, sooner or later, it will become costlier to purchase. And that means, all sorts of things that depend on oil will become costlier. Therefore, we won’t be able to continue our current lifestyle.</p>
<p>I guess that unless we have some technological breakthroughs regarding fuels, we will face a massive degradation in our lifestyles. We need to be prepared for that. For example, we may not be able to keep buying awesome-cool electronic gadgets and cars and stuff. That will become way costlier cos oil is used all the way from extraction to production to distribution to marketing and stuff.</p>
<p>This means that if we’re taking decisions assuming that things will be hunky-dory in the future, we could be in a for a nasty shock. If we take on huge loans (for education, or a big house, or whatever), we might find ourselves crushed under their load when things become tight. Those things are based on the assumption that the future will be one of expansion, not of contraction.</p>
<hr />
<p>Cool. So Peak Oil may not be scary for the reasons that people usually claim.</p>
<p>However, there is a legitimate concern - pollution and climate change. This is a negative externality - it is not covered by the market and nobody is paying (directly) for the right to pollute. In other words, when I drive a car and send up harmful gases into the atmosphere, it hurts you and others, but I’m not compensating you at all. I’m not paying the full price for the consequences of my actions. This is what they call a market failure.</p>
<h1 id="question-about-prices-and-the-future">Question about Prices and the Future</h1>
<p>If prices incorporate all the information we have, then if we <em>knew</em> that with high probability the future was gonna be screwed, won’t that be reflected in the prices?</p>
<h1 id="y-u-no-look-at-sustainability">Y U NO look at Sustainability?</h1>
<p>It’s been a LONG time since I looked at my sustainability resources. So long ago that I was a religious guy back then. These kind of doomsday / unsustainable lifestyle facts made it easier to believe in God. It was easy to shift focus from the futile attempts to live well on this planet and instead look to create a path to eternal salvation. Ah, those were the days.</p>
<p>Sadly, I’m not a religious guy anymore. And the reason I didn’t look at sustainability for two years after that was because I kind of became a nihilist - nothing really matters, everything is screwed up anyway, f*ck this shit, and so on.</p>
<p>However, I discovered a purpose in life again (long story that). Things matter once more.</p>
<p>But, still, for the last one year, I didn’t really look at sustainability too closely. I mean, the same arguments have held, but somehow they didn’t perturb me much.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Cos I was convinced that, sooner or later, Science would conquer these problems. I had no clue how, of course, but if there was a way, Science would find it. This would be just one of the many problems getting crushed under the Wheels of Science.</p>

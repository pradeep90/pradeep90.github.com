<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What is causing me this pain?</p>
<h1 id="what-causes-rsi">What causes RSI?</h1>
<p>First, what is RSI?</p>
<p>From a <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cscott/rsi.html">helpful website</a> on RSI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In simple medical terms, repetitive strain injury (RSI) is defined as a cumulative trauma disorder (CTD) stemming from prolonged repetitive, forceful, or awkward hand movements. The result is damage to muscles, tendons, and nerves of the neck, shoulder, forearm, and hand, which can cause pain, weakness, numbness, or impairment of motor control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, is it just some kind of fatigue thing? Like, you know, when you walk for long or exercise your muscles, you feel tired. Is this like that?</p>
<p>Nah. It seems there is some real physical damage happening.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may wonder how seemingly innocuous activities such as typing and clicking a mouse button could possibly be harmful. Fine hand movements, repeated <em>hour after hour</em>, day after day, <em>thousands upon thousands</em> of times, eventually strain the muscles and tendons of the forearms, wrists, and fingers, causing <strong>microscopic tears</strong>. Injured muscles tend to contract, decreasing the range of motion necessary for stress free work. The sheaths that cover delicate tendons run out of lubrication because they aren’t given time to rest, so tendon and sheath chafe, resulting in pain. Due to this abrasion, tendons become inflamed, and begin to pinch neighboring nerves. This can result in numbness, tingling, or hypersensitivity to touch. Unless this cycle is interrupted, it repeats itself over and over, and a long-term, <em>chronic problem</em> results.</p>
<p>– <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cscott/rsi.html">Carl’s page on RSI</a></p>

<h1 id="when">When?</h1>
<p>When do I feel pain?</p>
<p>While typing for long periods. These days, it’s hurting me constantly. A month ago, there was little or no pain while I was typing.</p>
<p>When riding my bicycle, I could feel a tingling sensation in my hands.</p>
<p>When writing with a pen.</p>
<p>When using a ladle while cooking.</p>
<p>When playing video games.</p>
<p>And other assorted places.</p>
<h1 id="warning-signs">Warning Signs</h1>
<p>By simply googling for a few minutes, I came across <a href="http://www.rsi.deas.harvard.edu/">tons</a> <a href="http://www.rsihelp.com/">of</a> <a href="http://www.tifaq.org/">resources</a> talking about other people’s experience with RSI. I’m not alone in this. It’s not because I’m doing ultra-crap stuff in an ultra-crap retarded way that I’m suffering like this.</p>
<p>It happens to a lot of people. It’s not like you have to use Emacs or Vim a lot or type a lot or whatever to get RSI. It takes some simple stuff that nearly everybody does.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The three primary risk factors are poor posture, poor technique, and overuse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I get the feeling this is like smoking. It kills different people at different times even if they smoke the same amount.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may be at risk for developing an RSI if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have poor posture</li>
<li>Have poor technique</li>
<li>Use a computer more than <strong>two to four hours</strong> a day</li>
<li>Have a job that requires <strong>constant computer use</strong>, especially heavy input</li>
<li>Don’t take <em>frequent breaks</em></li>
<li>Are loose-jointed</li>
<li>Don’t exercise regularly</li>
<li>Work in a high-pressure environment</li>
<li>Have arthritis, diabetes, or another serious medical condition</li>
<li>Keep your fingernails long</li>
<li>Have an <strong>unhealthy, stressful, or sedentary lifestyle</strong> (yes to all?)</li>
<li>Weigh more than you should</li>
<li>Don’t sleep well</li>
<li>Are afraid to ask for better accommodations</li>
<li>Won’t accept that you are at risk when you really are</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I bet each of us spends at least 4 hours in front of the computer, if not more. We spend more than 8 hours of our day sitting at a desk, be it at work or college or whatever. And then, we spend some more time sitting at a desk (or lying on our bed), watching movies on a computer, or surfing blogs online on a computer, or doing our homework on a computer, whatever.</p>
<h1 id="canary-in-a-coal-mine">Canary in a coal mine</h1>
<p>This shit is unprecedented. Our bodies aren’t optimized for this kind of behaviour.</p>
<p>We are killing our hands and fingers in unprecedented ways. And our necks and spines and arms and everything.</p>
<p>I get the feeling we are all in for some big trouble when we grow older. We are the first generation of humans to have such easy and constant access to computers all the time. No such generation has ever grown old. Which means that we don’t know what the repercussions will be as we grow old. Already, a lot of crap happens as you grow old (look around you). The default itself is pretty crap. We are making it even worse.</p>
<p>We weren’t designed to be so sedentary. And we weren’t designed to do so much crap on our computers.</p>
<p>And yes, it may seem like I’m going overboard with this thing because I’m currently suffering.</p>
<p>Nah. I think my current pain is like the canary in a coal mine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Canaries were once regularly used in coal mining as an early warning system. Toxic gases … in the mine would kill the bird before affecting the miners. Signs of distress from the bird indicated to the miners that conditions were unsafe.</p>
<p>– source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_Canary#Miner.27s_canary">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is just a sign of things to come. There are massive amounts of people out there spending massive amounts of time typing stuff on Facebook, or programming, or just generally surfing the web, or just doing their job. Notice how all jobs these days seem to involve sitting at a computer?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sheldon Cooper: Perhaps we could expand our market.<br /> Penny: How are flower barrettes gonna appeal to men?<br /> Howard Wolowitz: We add Bluetooth!<br /> Sheldon Cooper: Brilliant! Men love Bluetooth!<br /> Penny: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You want to make a hair barrette with Bluetooth?<br /> Sheldon Cooper: Penny - <strong>Everything</strong> is better with Bluetooth. <br /></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, <strong>everything</strong> is better with a computer, right? It’s just axiomatically right.</p>
<p>How could a computer possibly make things worse?</p>
<h1 id="living-in-harmony-with-our-body">Living in harmony with our Body</h1>
<p>If the lifestyle we are living is hugely incompatible with the way our bodies are designed, and if using computers so much is actively harming us, shouldn’t we do something about it? Shouldn’t we make some drastic changes?</p>
<p>Is it best that we live with so much stress in our lives? Our body is designed to take ultra-short-term stresses, like a tiger, not ultra-long-term stresses like “office tension” or health worries or whatever.</p>
<p>Is it best that we live our whole lives in such a sedentary fashion?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Dude! <em>Everybody</em> is doing it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole world may be making this mistake, doesn’t mean we should. They were making this mistake back when smoking was in vogue. <em>Everybody</em> smoked. Fast forward to 2014. Go and look outside the gates of offices. There stand the last remnants of the cigarette-smokers.</p>
<p>We need to question every single motherf*cking assumption that we’re making in our modern lifestyle. We can’t go on like this and hope that everything will work out <em>somehow</em>. We need to break away from this madness, and soon. This hand pain thing is just the start.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits, you’re all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could <del>live so large</del> abuse your body so much and leave so little thought for your body’s optimal living.</p>
<p>– Selina Kyle, yesterday</p>

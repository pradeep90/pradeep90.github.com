<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: Do you have low self-esteem? Cool. I guess I do. Are you judgemental?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="first-things">First things</h1>
<p>Get yourself tested.</p>
<p>Not for STDs, just LSE.</p>
<p>Take this free online scientific test - <a href="http://personality-testing.info/tests/RSE.php">Rosenberg Self Esteem scale</a></p>
<p>Good to know.</p>
<h1 id="what-causes-low-self-esteem">What causes low self-esteem?</h1>
<p>Million-dollar question. Further discussion and potential solutions coming up in future essays.</p>
<p>Today, we’re just gonna have an informal discussion.</p>
<p>They say it is easier to notice crap in others than to see the shit you’re covered in. One, of course, thinks that “they” are full of shit “them”selves.</p>
<h1 id="how-judgemental-are-you">How judgemental are you?</h1>
<p>I don’t know of any standard psychological test that measures this.</p>
<p>Let’s make one up.</p>
<p>So far, I have generally been rather exacting in the things that I praise.</p>
<p>You know what they say about having high standards and stuff.</p>
<p>Hmmm… maybe I took that a bit too far.</p>
<p>Maybe I’ve been criticizing people for falling even slightly off the wagon.</p>
<p>This has caused some people to call me a “perfectionist” and stuff.</p>
<p>I would say “I have changed. I no longer try to overlook human limitations and expect very good performance in every single area from everybody.”</p>
<p>But I’m not allowed to say that. Why, you ask. No <a href="./Regret-without-Action.html">Regret without Action</a>. I can only allow myself to take credit for whatever stuff I correct in action. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Name three examples, SPK.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure. Er… ummm… Coming Soon.</p>
<h1 id="judging-the-most-important-person-in-the-world">Judging the most important person in the world</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>There are all kinds of courage. It takes a great deal of courage to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends</p>
<p>– Thalaivar Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which one might humbly add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And it takes a f*ckload more to stand up to oneself.</p>
<p>– Some Random Rationality Writer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you say when you fail to keep a commitment to yourself?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A: You idiot! How could you fail to do such a simple that? What’s wrong with you? F*ck, man! This is the fiftieth time you have failed. I mean, seriously, how difficult is it to f*cking do a little bit of Rational thinking everyday?</p></li>
<li><p>B: Hey! I understand, man. You were really tired after a full day at work. It was difficult to even think straight and you just wanted to relax for a while. Cool. Next time, let’s figure out a way to do it when we have more energy.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You may even feel like justifying your tough words. You may say, “Dude, if I let myself off the hook whenever I screw up, I will just take advantage of it and never get anything hard done.”</p>
<p>A lot LOT more on this coming soon.</p>
<h1 id="judging-a-young-newcomer-who-looks-up-to-you">Judging a young newcomer who looks up to you</h1>
<p>Now, say there’s a young person in your area. He comes to you for guidance in the field of Rationality. You take him under your wings and mentor him regularly. You find that he has a lot of potential, a very sharp mind, and a hunger to prove himself.</p>
<p>You feel good. Yup. This guy, he’s gonna make it real good. He’s gonna do really well. You can feel it right away.</p>
<p>He even does a good job for the first couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Then, when you meet him after a month, he tells you that he tried to keep doing some reading and stuff regularly but wasn’t able to. He is in the third year of engineering college and has a lot of course-work and is also busily looking around for an internship. You KNOW his life is very full and busy.</p>
<p>He looks up to you and respects you a lot. Whatever you say goes right to his heart. If you praise something he does, he makes sure to it extra well next time. But if you do say something negative, it will hurt him really hard too.</p>
<p>You know this.</p>
<p>What do you say to him?</p>
<p>A or B?</p>
<h1 id="self-compassion">Self-Compassion</h1>
<p>By now, you should know what I’m gonna ask you to do.</p>
<p>It’s obvious.</p>
<p>Go and kick that guy’s ass. Tell him to man the f*ck up and get his shit in order. I mean, seriously, how can he expect to achieve <em>anything</em> in life with that attitude?</p>
<p>Well, after you’ve done that, I’m gonna ask you to replace that poor little guy with the most important person in the world.</p>
<p>You. Yes, you!</p>
<p>Why won’t you criticize that young upcoming rational thinker? Cos you know that we are humans and that we will all face setbacks along our way. And that if you are heavy-handed with your judgement, you could crush a budding plant.</p>
<p>So, forgive yourself a bit more. For me.</p>
<p>(I’ll return the favour and forgive myself here and there on your account :P)</p>
<p>And once you’re done giving yourself some self-love, think about giving some to others too.</p>
<p>Notice when you’re being judgemental towards others. Being judgemental when you look at others will carry forward when you’re looking at yourself.</p>
<p>Could it be that being judgemental (towards others and therefore towards yourself) is causing your low self-esteem?</p>
<p>Watch out for lots more coming soon.</p>

<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: ??</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="empty-techniques">Empty Techniques</h1>
<p>I think the trouble is that we <em>think</em> we have some “techniques”, when in reality we have nothing. Just a bunch of words. “Scientific Method”, “Deliberate Practice”, whatever. Those words don’t mean anything. All they do is make us <em>think</em> we understand the underlying techniques. We might be able to win intellectual arguments with others, we might be able to recite the elements of the technique (“Step One: Form a hypothesis. Step Two: …”), we might be able to point out flaws in other people’s thinking, we might be able to point to huge mounds of scientific literature where other people have got lots of benefits from the technique.</p>
<p>But what we cannot do is <em>actually</em> use the technique ourselves and get some benefits.</p>
<p><em>This</em> is what I mean by empirically testing your “techniques”. It’s not enough if you can talk about the technique. It’s not enough if you can point to the books and articles you’ve read about the technique. It’s not enough if you can speak for hours about it. It’s not enough if a hundred studies show that this technique <em>works</em>.</p>
<p>You - you, personally - have to be able to use it and get real, honest-to-God results in real-world conditions. No Impact, No Right to Talk.</p>
<p>“The Scientific Method” doesn’t count. “Positive Psychology” doesn’t count. “Deliberate Practice” doesn’t count. None of it counts. That’s just some words you heard on Youtube or read online. Are <em>you</em> able to get empirical results in those areas? If not, shut the f*ck up.</p>
<p>That warning applies to you, me, and everybody else in the world. We are all deluding ourselves about the “techniques” we “know”.</p>
<h1 id="real-skills">Real Skills</h1>
<p>It seems there are at least two ways things that look like Skills can fail to be Skills. Either they haven’t been empirically tested by running lots of experiments on lots of people in lots of situations, or you haven’t understood them correctly and can’t use them in real-life but <em>think</em> that you can.</p>
<p>The first problem can be remedied by accepting only those techniques that have a lot of empirical evidence backing them. Refuse to acknowledge “techniques” that sound reasonable but have no data backing them up.</p>
<p>As to the second problem, make sure you empirically test your own understanding of a technique. Refuse to let yourself think that you “know” a technique unless you can show the empirical results you have got out of it.</p>
<p>Most smart people come around to recognizing the first problem. They realize that it is unwise to trust untested advice. However, I think that people, including myself, get tripped up when it comes to checking whether <em>we</em> personally possess the technique or not.</p>
<p>We don’t test ourselves empirically. We trust our feelings - “I got this. I know how to do it”. Every single disappointment you faced in an exam is testimony to this. An exam is a pure empirical test of your understanding. No excuses. You either actually know it or you don’t. Your feelings about your level of expertise are irrelevant.</p>
<h1 id="constraints-on-skills">Constraints on Skills</h1>
<p>First, we cannot go around inventing lots of techniques ourselves. We don’t have the time or the ability to do that. More to the point, we can’t get enough empirical evidence to overcome the biases that will fool us. Scientists in research labs will be able to test out techniques on lots of people and thus see whether it actually works. So, we should make sure to only accept techniques that have strong empirical evidence behind them.</p>
<p>Second, we should only claim the level of benefit that is backed by the evidence, not by our feelings. We might think that Positive Psychology (or the Scientific Method or Deliberate Practice or whatever) is the best thing since sliced bread and will solve all our problems, but we have to limit ourselves to the benefits empirically seen.</p>
<p>It may <em>feel</em> like this is an Epic Awesome Technique and is <em>obviously</em> going to change <em>everything</em>, but we have to limit our enthusiasm to the exact benefits they’ve found in the research. If it empirically only makes you a slight bit better, don’t go prancing around like you’ve improved like hell (even if it feels that way). You can’t trust your feelings.</p>
<p>Third, rigorously test your own understanding of the “technique” you discovered. The above points were about the techniques themselves. This is about your grasp of the technique. Allow yourself only as much pride and joy as the empirical evidence supports. Even if you <em>feel</em> like you’re doing a 100x better than you were last time, actually go and test it out with some Measurement tool. Even if you <em>feel</em> like you’ve lost a ton of weight after doing exercise for the last three weeks, actually go and check your weight on the weighing machine.</p>
<p>Four, knowing about a technique is not the same as actually using it regularly. You may know of techniques that will increase your happiness (keeping a Gratitude journal, helping others personally, being mindful and savouring pleasures), but that won’t make you happy by itself. You have to <em>actually</em> use them every single day. What do I mean by that? You must have empirical evidence that you’re using that technique a lot. Just feeling that “I use it lots of times” doesn’t count. You must have some objective data - maybe journal notes, or some online stats, whatever. You can say that you use a certain technique only when you have empirical evidence that says you actually do.</p>
<p>All this to say:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your beliefs about the efficacy of techniques should be determined <em>entirely</em> by the empirical evidence.</p></li>
<li><p>Your beliefs about your mastery of techniques should be determined <em>entirely</em> by the empirical evidence.</p></li>
<li><p>Your claims about the world should be <em>exactly</em> as specified by the empirical evidence. Nothing more, nothing less.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>(Note: There is a small caveat here. As you become more experienced in a domain, your intuitive measurements about how well you did usually correlate strongly with the empirical measurements. In that case, you can put some weight behind your inner judgments. But, given how f*cked up the human brain is, you’re best off seeking empirical evidence wherever possible.)</p>
<h1 id="empirically-backed-skills">Empirically-backed Skills</h1>
<p>So, assume we collect techniques that are backed by empirical evidence (i.e., scientific techniques), and we become only as enthusiastic about them as the evidence warrants.</p>
<p>How do we make sure we actually understand them?</p>
<p>We can first check to make sure there is a particular step-by-step plan that we can follow. We don’t just go by our gut feeling - we actually look at each step on the plan they give.</p>
<p>Next, we ensure that we have a performance measure to judge ourselves with. No performance measure implies mental masturbation.</p>
<p>Then, we actually test it out by doing it a few times and seeing if there is any measurable increase in performance (as per the Measurement tool).</p>
<p>If so, cool, we actually do have a Skill, and not just an imaginary “Skill”.</p>
<p>We collect all such empirical Skills from the domains. And then, we practice the f*ck out of them. We make sure that we’re <em>actually</em> practicing by keeping objective notes of the amount we do.</p>
<p>At regular points, hopefully continuously, we check our progress. If our performance keeps going up, we’re in business.</p>
<h1 id="home-grown-ideas">Home-grown ideas</h1>
<p>What if you come up with a technique of your own? Should you trust it?</p>
<p>Check if it has a proper step-by-step plan out on paper, not just vague instructions in your head. Make sure you have a good Measurement tool to gauge your performance. Then, follow the steps and look for an increase in performance. If it does, cool, you may have a technique there. If not, get back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>Of course, you need to test your technique rigorously, under all sorts of conditions, over long periods of time, to make sure it does deliver performance.</p>
<p>I think that we all do ok on the step-by-step plan. We may know what to do and so on. Where I fail, and maybe you too, is that we don’t check with some objective Measurement tool. We just accept our feeling of “This thing works for sure! I <em>know</em> it!”</p>
<p>Failure to test empirically. That’s what does us in.</p>
<h1 id="what-skills-do-we-have-then">What Skills do we have, then?</h1>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Condense</p>
<ul>
<li>We THINK some technique works. It actually doesn’t. No empirical evidence.</li>
<li>We THINK we have understood some technique. We actually haven’t. No empirical evidence.</li>
<li>We THINK we use some technique a lot. We actually don’t. No empirical evidence.</li>
<li><p>What to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Accept only techniques that have given empirical results.</li>
<li>Claim only the level of benefit that is supposed by empirical evidence (NOT “Epic Awesome”).</li>
<li><p>Say that you use a technique ONLY when you have empirical evidence that says you do.</p>
<p>Helpful hint: Step-by-step plan, Measurement tool</p>
<p>Give concrete examples here.</p></li>
<li><p>Say you have a technique ONLY when you can actually execute it and get measurable benefits.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In short, your beliefs about the efficacy of a technique, your usage and mastery of it, and your claims about the world should be <em>exactly</em> as specified by the empirical evidence. Caveat.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“I have come up with a technique of my own”</p>
<p>Empirical step-by-step plan. Empirical Measurement tool. Empirically do it and look for increase in performance. Empirically test it rigorously in different conditions, over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Biggest Failure Mode: Not checking with a Measurement tool.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Severely Counter Naive Realism and Taboo each domain and skill.</p></li>
<li><p>Discover empirical Skills. Practice the f*ck out of them.</p></li>
<li><p>Idea: After</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Big Problems is my current <em>hypothesis</em></p></li>
<li><p>Motivation Performance Measure</p></li>
<li><p>Truth Performance Measure</p></li>
<li><p>You have to <em>personally</em> get empirical results. No excuses.</p></li>
<li><p>This is where most smart people get tripped up. We are skeptical about the techniques other people hand us, but not skeptical enough about our own understanding.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>TODO: Technique vs Skill. Clarify or edit.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What the fuck am I doing?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="not-writing-for-others">Not Writing for Others</h1>
<p>Stop fucking around.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>How do I keep it real?</p>
<p>I keep <a href="./Writing-for-Others.html">talking about</a> how I don’t want to write for others, how writing for others is getting me nowhere, and how I have a million ways in which I need to improve.</p>
<p>What have I done about that?</p>
<p>I’m neither here near there. I’m not improving myself and neither am I improving anyone else.</p>
<p>What is the chance that people will read these essays and take action on whatever <del>ideas</del> shoelaces there are in them? Next to zero. Why? Cos no one reads them. Next, even if they did, they wouldn’t be convinced by any of them. You need to be pretty open-minded and growth-oriented already to take what I’m saying. Then, even if they did agree that these shoelaces are right, they won’t <a href="./Regret-without-Action.html">take any action</a> on them.</p>
<p>And even if they do take action, it will be pretty feeble, like a lone candle in the wind. It won’t be long before it is extinguished. How do I know that? Cos I wrote all these essays and I have done bull-squat about any of the ideas. To expect anybody else to come and take it on is just ludicrous.</p>
<p>So, the probability of someone else taking action on any ideas in these essays is very low, and even if they do, the value of the action they take will be very low because humans suck at these kinds of things by default. Hence, the expected value, which is the probability times the value is very very low.</p>
<p>Which means, I shouldn’t be fucking writing for others at all.</p>
<p>Second, why write for myself? What is the probability and value of me taking action on these ideas?</p>
<p>The probability of me taking action is very low. How do I know that? The data speaks for itself. I’ve done nothing so far on all the <a href="./Low-Information-Diet.html">awesome ideas I have come across</a>. And the value - well, yeah, it would be pretty fucking valuable if I did take action and stuff. So, the expected value is okay-ish.</p>
<p>In any case, I don’t have any other option. I am not content to sit and just go through life as usual. Can’t. Why not? Can’t really explain right now.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="how-do-i-keep-from-writing-for-others">How do I keep from writing for others?</h1>
<p>Instead of mentally masturbating about it and then doing nothing.</p>
<p>Who are the others I’m talking about here?</p>
<p>I don’t really include my esteemed co-conspirator, Mr. Agent, in that list.</p>
<p>It’s about the future readers. I’m imagining people who will actually read the blog and get convinced and do stuff about it. So yeah, in my mind, I’m hoping to write a lot of good stuff, and then, one day, publicize it so that it can reach more people.</p>
<p>Remember the young wide-eyed n00b I was talking about, the guy who is hungry for guidance and will just zoom up like hell in life if he could be pointed in the right direction? I’m imagining a bunch of such people. I believe, and I hope you’ll agree with me, that there is tremendous potential out there and shit.</p>
<p>You and I may have become convinced of some things and decided to go on this path of “rationality” or whatever. We haven’t got any results yet, obviously. But we believe that there will be lots of good results in the future if we keep working on this path. What is so special about me? I think there are a lot of people out there who could benefit just as much as me, if not more.</p>
<p>Anyway… what’s the problem with that? It all sounds good, right?</p>
<h1 id="the-problem-with-writing-for-others">The problem with writing for others</h1>
<p>(Yes, this is a repetition. Bear with me. Remember the Mother of all Skill.)</p>
<p>The problem is that when I’m writing for others, I’m almost certainly not writing for myself.</p>
<p>When I write for others, I’m writing about topics that I think I <em>know</em>, ideas that I have <em>understood</em>. And so, it ends up seeming to my mind like I’m getting nothing out of the essay.</p>
<p>Examples? The initial essays on Akrasia and Will Power. I’ve known about these things for a while now. I felt like those were the most crap essays I have ever written. The worst essay I’ve written about a topic that I struggled comes nowhere near these essays in terms of sucking. These just suck balls. In the essays where I struggled, I got something out of it. I came out of it stronger. Here, I came out with nothing.</p>
<p>Then, there is the desire to please. I want to write well so that others will praise me and shit. They will say (in the future), “Ah… nice essays… nice writing… I like it. I’ll read more and I will get convinced.” In fact, whether they get convinced or not isn’t even the point to my mind. It is just great that they like it and think I’m worth something.</p>
<p>These two forces push me to focus on essay topics that are diametrically opposite to the topics that will be good for me.</p>
<p>And sadly, the single best way hands down to convince all those future people is for me to make myself stronger. Everything else will come. The stronger I am the better I will write / put across my ideas / train others. The stronger I am, the more I will achieve and the more people will pay attention to what I’m saying.</p>
<p>The equation is trivial. If what I really want is to improve the lives of those future readers and make them awesome, what I should focus on is <strong>making myself stronger</strong>.</p>
<p>Not 30% or 50% or 60%. It’s not that I should focus a lot on making myself stronger and then spend the remaining energy on trying to convince them.</p>
<p>Nope. The way ahead is clear. Focus <em>completely</em> on trying to make myself stronger.</p>
<p>Yo, motherfucker! Even if you gave it everything you had, you still wouldn’t become 10% stronger. And here you are, giving it 1% of your attention, and spending the rest of your precious little mental energy on trying to make it look good for future generations.</p>
<p>Fuck that shit, man.</p>
<p>Focus <strong>only</strong> on improving yourself for now.</p>
<p>When the time comes, you will convince others. Right now, you have neither the awesome life-changing ideas nor the ability to persuade others. What the fuck do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p>Focus <strong>only</strong> on improving yourself for now.</p>
<h1 id="keep-it-real">Keep it Real</h1>
<!-- LINK -->
<p>I’ve come to that conclusion before. In past essays, I’ve realized this exact same thing.</p>
<p>What’s different now?</p>
<p>Well, what did I do about it before? I just <em>said</em> that I would <em>try</em> to not write for others.</p>
<p>No Action, No Right to Talk. There was nothing making sure I would absolutely not write for others at all.</p>
<p>I don’t pretend to have a complete solution now.</p>
<p>But this is what I’m gonna do.</p>
<p>After every two weeks, I will delete all that posts that came up in the previous two weeks.</p>
<p>Which means, each essay will live in this world for a maximum of two weeks.</p>
<p>Nobody will ever get to read any of them after two weeks. No future readers, nothing.</p>
<!-- LINK -->
<p>Why do I even publish essays? Why not just write them on my computer? I’ve answered this before. It forces me to actually make sense instead of just making sense in my head. The latter can be faked, my mind can deceive me. The former is hard to fake. Writing for others will make you put your thoughts explicitly and in full. There won’t be any gaps that you can hand-wave over, the way you can do it while thinking alone.</p>
<h1 id="correction">Correction</h1>
<p>Actually, by writing for others, I include writing for friends and co-conspirators. That too is tripping me up.</p>
<p>I’m not writing for anybody’s education here. Not future readers, not co-conspirators, not friends, nobody.</p>
<p>The only one benefiting from this website for the next three months, at least, will be… yours truly.</p>
<p>Which means I shouldn’t be writing introductory posts about Will Power or anything. Fuck all that crap.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Won’t it help others? Won’t they be able to use it their lives?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No and no. It won’t help them and they won’t be able to use it in their lives.</p>
<p>It’s a fact. Nobody will be able to use these ideas in their lives. If they did, they would have become awesomely great and we would have heard about them and they would have, hopefully, passed on their wisdom to others. They haven’t.</p>
<p>So far, you can explain people’s success almost completely by their native intelligence and how hard they have worked at it. “Rationality” (meaning here the set of ideas and tools and tips and techniques and other bullshit) has got pretty much nothing to do with.</p>
<p>What has your Rationality really done for you?</p>
<p>If your Rationality really is so great, it should have be capable of taking even ordinary people to insane heights. Or, at least, those who are “gifted”. Nope. People are achieving what they would otherwise have achieved without all these extra knowledge. People who have all this “rationality” knowledge aren’t beating the crap out of people who don’t. You can’t even tell them apart. In that case, what is the point of reading and learning about “Rationality” as it currently stands? No Impact, No Right to Talk.</p>
<p>So, yeah. I’m not even gonna write for my friends and stuff.</p>
<p>It’s gonna be <strong>only</strong> for me.</p>
<h1 id="collect-our-thoughts">Collect our thoughts</h1>
<p>No thinking about future publicity and future readers. To this end, deleting of posts after two weeks.</p>
<p>No thinking about friends.</p>
<p>In fact, the reason I write about introductory topics (or ideas that I “understand”) is my belief or wish that my material should be so good that anybody can take it up and become awesome. Remember how I was cursing the state of the art of “rationality”, how I said it has done nothing for you? If it were awesome, it should be able to lift anybody.</p>
<p>I wanted my site to be like that. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow… but in a year’s time.</p>
<p>That was my aim. That is why I rather pompously called this site “SPK’s Rationality Training Ground”. I meant it. I wanted this to be a Training Ground, a Bootcamp, like a Martial Arts Training Center, only 200x more effective.</p>
<p>But so far it’s just been “SPK’s Crap Ground”.</p>
<p>Don’t think I’m being pessimistic or overly hard on myself. This is just based on the facts.</p>
<p>I don’t think things are gonna change anytime soon.</p>
<p>This website has sucked for making any meaningful change in anybody’s life.</p>
<p>Remember, I will not be satisfied until there is an actual Impact. Mere “acceptance” of ideas is worthless to me. Hearing “you’re right” will be worthless to me. A hundred views, a hundred thousand views will be worthless if there is no Impact anywhere.</p>
<h1 id="returning-to-the-mother-city">Returning to the Mother City</h1>
<p>You know what, I need to make this site get back to its roots.</p>
<p>It needs to live up to its name.</p>
<p>It needs to be “SPK’s Rationality Training Ground” - the ground where SPK fucking trains hard for Rationality. Not training for others. Training for SPK. This is not “Other-People-in-the-Future’s Rationality Training Ground”. This is “SPK’s Rationality Training Ground”. And so it shall be.</p>
<p>This is why I kept tripping up. I wrote all those posts trying to get my ass moving on the real hard problems that are staring me in the face every minute. Nothing came of it. Because, somewhere deep down, I was still writing in part for others.</p>
<p>And, “in part for others” means I was writing more or less for others. It was like I was cooking the main course for others and eating the left-overs on the table. Sure, they were delicious but they have nowhere near the impact of having the whole main course yourself. You don’t become a strong warrior by eating left-overs on the table. You need every single bit of nutrition you can get if you want to become strong.</p>
<p>This is what it is gonna be about. Obtaining food and consuming it fully myself. Cooking it with the express purpose of nourishing my mind. Not caring about how it tastes to others, how it looks, nothing. All that matters is the impact it has on my mind.</p>
<p>When I read my old essays during lunch or whatever, I am always struck by the essays I ended up writing for myself. It’s hits me in the face with every single paragraph. It doesn’t have a tenth of the force of a Paul Graham essay but it’s still packs a punch. It’s like I’m talking to an intelligent guy on the other side. Remember, after a few days, I have forgotten all the stuff that was going through my mind when I wrote the essay. It is as if someone else wrote it. Yeah, this guy has got some good ideas. Hmmm… damn… it really makes sense. I should be taking action on this.</p>
<h1 id="no-more-crap">No more crap</h1>
<h1 id="keep-finite-will-power-in-mind">Keep Finite Will Power in mind</h1>
<h1 id="take-action-right-now">Take Action Right Now</h1>
<p>I need to start right now. I’m already late. There is already a very high probability that I’m too late.</p>
<p>I have loads more I need to do. I need to become stronger. I need more power.</p>
<p>And what am I doing with my time? How am I investing my scarce mental abilities? Worrying about how to write some C++ program and how not to suck at it and stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What do we really want from Deliberate Practice?</p>
<p><strong>Essay Status</strong>: In progress.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="skill">Skill</h1>
<p>Skill is nothing but getting some kind of Impact in a particular way.</p>
<p>The skill of hitting cover drives is about hitting the ball through the cover region (Impact) by playing in the V (the way to do it).</p>
<p>Piano skill is about creating the right sounds at the right time from a piano (Impact) by pressing the right keys (the way to do it). The music is what matters.</p>
<p>Programming skill is about creating the right kind of programs - working, readable, extensible, etc (Impact) by writing it all out by yourself and your editor (the way to do it).</p>
<h2 id="skill-level">Skill level</h2>
<p>What does it mean to say that you have a certain skill level in a field?</p>
<p>Answer: You are <em>consistently</em> able to get a certain amount of Impact (in the way that the skill specifies).</p>
<p>Example: If you consider batsmanship to be the skill of getting hundreds and having a high average and doing it with a high strike rate, then Sachin has high skill as a batsman. Sachin is able to get lots of hundreds, lots of runs, high average, decent strike rate, etc. He is able to get the Impact we want from a batsman (as defined above).</p>
<p>It makes no sense to talk about “skill level” in isolation without mentioning the Impact you want from it. “Sachin is highly skilled” - some guy says this, the other guy disagrees, and they end up arguing for hours. Yo! What do you mean “highly skilled”? Define the <em>Impact</em> you expect and then fight.</p>
<h1 id="skill-and-impact">Skill and Impact</h1>
<p>We need to distinguish between the Skill and the Impact we want from that Skill. You do different things to get each one.</p>
<p>To get more Impact, you use the relevant Skill. While batting, you want to score boundaries. So, you use the Skill of “cover drive” to score boundaries. You want to keep scoring boundaries, you keep using your “cover drive” Skill (among others).</p>
<p>To get more Skill, you use Deliberate Practice. Before the match, you want to improve your “cover drive” Skill. So, you practice it rigorously, using exercises designed to increase your performance (hitting the middle of the bat, hitting in the gap, hitting along the ground) with tight feedback and lots of repetitions.</p>

<h1 id="reverse-engineer-and-re-create">Reverse-Engineer and Re-Create</h1>
<p>Once you break the big-ass Impact into specific little Impacts, you can easily identify the skills that can get you there.</p>
<p>Look at people who are great at getting that Impact and then tease out the specific skills they use to get it. <strong>Identify the masters and ask - How did they do it?</strong></p>
<p>For example, Ganguly gets a lot of his boundaries on the off-side. How does he do it? Lots of cuts and cover drives. Cool. I’ll have some of that. Sachin gets lots of fours down the ground. How does he do it? Straight drive. Awesome.</p>
<p>The point is to reverse-engineer the skills of the experts so well that, given enough time and data and resources, you should be able to <em>re-create</em> their performance. You should be able to get to their skill level and get the results they get. That is the true test for whether you have captured the essence of their mastery.</p>
<p>For the sciences, say, your aim is to get such a good grasp of their skills so that, given the data or resources that the scientists in that field possess, you should be able to derive all the important results they have got. For example, if you care about physics, then you should get such a good grasp of the scientific method that you would be able to derive stuff like gravity, laws of motion, thermodynamics, etc. from the necessary data without peeking at the textbook derivation.</p>
<p>If that seems daunting or impossible, we have to put things in historical perspective - <em>everything</em> was a brand-new mystery once upon a time. There was nothing magical about what Newton did or what Galileo did or what Einstein did. We live in a Merely Real World - no magic. All the mystery is in our heads. They applied some specific skills to get the results they got. Maybe the skills are too complex or too resource-intensive for us average people to master, but we need to accept first that they are just skills. It is doable in theory.</p>
<p>Let’s try to reverse-engineer the skills for Truth and Motivation.</p>
<h1 id="appendix">Appendix</h1>
<h2 id="truth-skills-for-later">Truth Skills for later</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I want to gain predictive power about how to make money. Who doesn’t? What are good ways to do so in the current economy?</p>
<p>I’m not saying I want to do this, but I might need to go down this road in the future. (What exactly would I do with the money? Coming soon.)</p></li>

<h1 id="ps-ideas">PS: Ideas</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Skill and Performance Criteria go hand in hand</p>
<p>Can’t talk about “Skill” without Criteria.</p></li>

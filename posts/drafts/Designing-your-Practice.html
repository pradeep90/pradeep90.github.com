<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What do we really want from Deliberate Practice?</p>
<p><strong>Essay Status</strong>: In progress.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="skill">Skill</h1>
<p>Skill is nothing but getting some kind of Impact in a particular way.</p>
<p>The skill of hitting cover drives is about hitting the ball through the cover region (Impact) by playing in the V (the way to do it).</p>
<p>Piano skill is about creating the right sounds at the right time from a piano (Impact) by pressing the right keys (the way to do it). The music is what matters.</p>
<p>Programming skill is about creating the right kind of programs - working, readable, extensible, etc (Impact) by writing it all out by yourself and your editor (the way to do it).</p>
<h2 id="skill-level">Skill level</h2>
<p>What does it mean to say that you have a certain skill level in a field?</p>
<p>Answer: You are <em>consistently</em> able to get a certain amount of Impact (in the way that the skill specifies).</p>
<p>Example: If you consider batsmanship to be the skill of getting hundreds and having a high average and doing it with a high strike rate, then Sachin has high skill as a batsman. Sachin is able to get lots of hundreds, lots of runs, high average, decent strike rate, etc. He is able to get the Impact we want from a batsman (as defined above).</p>
<p>It makes no sense to talk about “skill level” in isolation without mentioning the Impact you want from it. “Sachin is highly skilled” - some guy says this, the other guy disagrees, and they end up arguing for hours. Yo! What do you mean “highly skilled”? Define the <em>Impact</em> you expect and then fight.</p>
<h1 id="skill-and-impact">Skill and Impact</h1>
<p>We need to distinguish between the Skill and the Impact we want from that Skill. You do different things to get each one.</p>
<p>To get more Impact, you use the relevant Skill. While batting, you want to score boundaries. So, you use the Skill of “cover drive” to score boundaries. You want to keep scoring boundaries, you keep using your “cover drive” Skill (among others).</p>
<p>To get more Skill, you use Deliberate Practice. Before the match, you want to improve your “cover drive” Skill. So, you practice it rigorously, using exercises designed to increase your performance (hitting the middle of the bat, hitting in the gap, hitting along the ground) with tight feedback and lots of repetitions.</p>
<h1 id="what-do-you-want-to-practice">What do you want to practice?</h1>
<p>Okay. Now that we about Skill and the distinction between Skill and Impact, what are the Skills we need to master?</p>
<p>Let’s take a look back at our <a href="./The-Big-Problems.html">Big Problems</a>.</p>
<p>Truth-finding is a skill. And a very important one, as <a href="./The-Prediction-Game.html#the-most-important-thing-tm">we have seen</a>. We definitely need to improve our performance in this skill.</p>
<p>Generating Motivation for some activity is another skill. If we agree that Akrasia is one of the main bottlenecks in getting the Impact we want (I’ll talk about the other bottleneck soon), then we need to become much better at the skill of generating Motivation.</p>
<h1 id="narrowing-it-down">Narrowing it Down</h1>
<p>Is that all? We just named two things and called them “skills”. Should we just go ahead and practice them?</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Skill is defined by the Impact you want and the way you want to do it.</p>
<p>This was why I had spent the past couple of months being utterly confused about what to do with these two “skills”. I used a vague, implicit definition in my head without talking about the actual Impact I wanted.</p>
<p>If you are a master at “Truth-finding”, then, well, you should be able to discover the truth about anything, anywhere, anytime. Wow, that would be a handy skill. That would also be an insanely difficult skill to get in any reasonable time frame. It’s too broad. It’s daunting. I wouldn’t even know where to begin. On one hand, I would need great Impact from the skill. No Impact, No Right to Talk. On the other hand, I would need to learn and practice truly general techniques that can apply to any subject under the sun, not just math or economics or whatever.</p>
<p>If you had a fast computer for a brain, you could just apply (a restricted form of) Bayes Theorem over and over till you got to epic Predictive Power. But you don’t. Even within a single field, if you want to get great results, you need to learn very complex techniques that compensate for your brain’s fallibility and slowness. Just look at the advanced journals or textbooks in any major field. It is not a piece of cake. And if you want to get great results <em>across</em> many fields, with the aforementioned fallible and slow human brain, good lord, you’re screwed. I don’t know of any current techniques that can do the trick. The current Art of Rationality isn’t all that effective.</p>
<p>Which means, if a tractable solution is possible, we have to discover it anew. That is a tremendous challenge. Not happening anytime soon, not with the current level of human thinking (raw brainpower and methods of reasoning). No wonder I was stymied.</p>
<p>We need to restrict our scope, at least at the beginning. Start out with a smaller goal, get to it, and then see where to go from there. Instead of looking for awesomeness across all fields in general, let’s shoot for decent power in a couple of specific fields.</p>
<h2 id="its-not-optional">It’s not optional</h2>
<p>We would strictly be making a mistake if we went off and wasted time on other things. Time is scarce, especially time in your 20s. You have to narrow down the most essential skills.</p>
<h1 id="specifying-the-impact">Specifying the Impact</h1>
<p>Let’s come up with a Version 1.0.</p>
<h2 id="truth">Truth</h2>
<p>What is the Impact that I wish for when I say “truth-finding”? What is the outcome such that if I had it, I wouldn’t even need any more truth-finding skill? What is the equivalent of “hitting boundaries as a batsman” here?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I want to understand how the human mind does reasoning.</p>
<p>Test: Predict what will happen when you take on some task involving reasoning.</p>
<p>You should be able to see the strengths and limits of human thinking. What will I forget? What will I remember? Will I come up with creative insights? Which ones? What is the pattern there?</p>
<p>What inferences will I make? What inferences will I miss out on? Why?</p>
<p>Basically, to a certain extent, understand the thinking algorithms running inside the human brain. How do memory, attention, motivation, past experience, knowledge level, and general thinking abilities come together to decide the quality of your thinking?</p>
<p>Right now, it’s all just one giant mystery. No clue when I will be able to get creative insights (apart from essay-writing :P) or when I will make correct logical inferences or remember important information.</p>
<p>TODO: Some better tests</p></li>
<li><p>I want to understand human psychology better, especially Motivation. How does that really work? How can we make it happen the way we want?</p>
<p>TODO: Maybe f*ck the “human psychology” part.</p>
<p>Test: Predict which of my planned actions I will actually work on and which ones I will procrastinate on.</p>
<p>If I really am better at understanding human motivation, then I should be better able to see which of my plans will produce poor motivation (and thus make me procrastinate), and which ones will produce great motivation.</p>
<p>Test: Predict the outcomes of other people’s plans.</p>
<p>I should be able to tell whether their plans really will motivate them to take action.</p>
<p>Test: Predict what I will do in a given circumstance.</p>
<p>Test: Predict what others will do in a given circumstance.</p>
<p>That is the acid test of my understanding of motivation. If it is true that you do what you have most motivation for at any moment, then I should be able to infer your next action from my estimate of the motivation you have for various actions.</p>
<p>Test: Predict the change in my mood or emotions based on various events.</p>
<p>Test: Predict the change in someone else’s mood or emotions based on various events.</p>
<p>If I really am better at understanding human psychology, I should be better able to tell how I will react to various events. Ditto for other people and their reactions.</p>
<p>Test for knowledge of how to improve Motivation: Predict what will increase the chances of doing some activity.</p>
<hr />
<p>Note: This is about whether I <em>know</em> how Motivation works (predictive power), not about whether I can actually increase Motivation at will (which is a skill in its own right).</p>
<p>Also, the predictions don’t have to be 100% accurate or anything. Nothing ever is. They just have to have a better Prediction Score than my normal intuitions.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to gain predictive power about solving Math problems. Math is the engine behind the important fields. I would need to solve lots of Math problems to get good results in the fields I care about.</p>
<p>Specifically, Discrete Math, Probability Theory, Mathematical Logic, Computability, Decision Theory, etc.</p>
<p>Plus, I would like to be able to solve them quickly. It shouldn’t take several hours to solve one problem.</p>
<p>Test: My score on some standard test paper (maybe from some university).</p>
<p>If I’ve learned the skills necessary, I will be able to get high scores.</p>
<p>Test: The time it takes for me to solve some standard set of exercises in a topic (maybe from some math book)</p></li>
<li><p>I also want to be able to measure things - e.g., the effectiveness of my plans, value of studying some topic.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to research some ideas on my own.</p>
<p>I usually come up with some plausible ideas about how things work in some area but have no idea whether they really do work that way or if it’s just me failing to see otherwise. I need to research these ideas rigorously and see if there is already some scientific work that sheds light on these ideas. I need to test them (quickly, if possible).</p></li>
<li><p>I want to know what needs to be done to get the world into a more preferred state.</p>
<p>Right now, my thinking is distorted and obscured by many biases. They prevent us from seeing what really needs to be done, and instead occupy us with useless crap.</p>
<p>For example, we don’t feel that the future is real. We also aren’t able to scale up our intuitions to big numbers. So, we ignore the actions that would make a huge difference for the future.</p>
<p>I need to counter this. If this is what everybody ignores by default, then this is where we can get huge payoffs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That should do for now as far as Truth is concerned. The Truth about human psychology; Money, Math, and Measurements; Research and What needs to be done.</p>
<p>What does this <em>not</em> include? Getting to the truth about random stuff that is happening somewhere - would be cool, but it’s not on our menu. Discovering solutions to any problems that happen in your life - nope. Too broad. Not worth it.</p>
<p>We’re being narrow in our focus. We give up on these nice-to-have-but-not-worth-it Impacts, and focus on a few specific super-High-Value Impacts.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>What is the Impact I seek here?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I want to be able to study hard to get results in the fields above.</p>
<p>Techniques are useless without the Motivation to stick to the problems and see things through to the end.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to have the motivation to do lots of original thinking</p>
<p>I need to take the effort to understand stuff without just parroting it, and discover new things on my own. I need to have the desire to see things with fresh eyes and work for it.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to be able to do the uncomfortable and maybe tedious tasks required for the money-making stuff, if it comes to that</p>
<p>TODO: Needed now?</p>
<p>This might include networking, research, legwork, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to be able to do tons of hardcore Deliberate Practice</p>
<p>Ideas alone are worthless. You need to put in the effort to grow your skill.</p></li>
<li><p>I need to be able to stay focussed on these tasks and not get distracted by crap</p>
<p>This is, imho, the biggest failure mode. These are the termites that eat away at your plans from the inside.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to take action on stuff that I absolutely need to do but don’t feel like doing</p>
<p>There are several biases (like Scope Insensitivity, etc.) that keep us from <em>feeling</em> that something is important, even though it is. I need to feel motivation for doing these crucial things, else there is no point to the rest of my actions. I would have won the battles but lost the war.</p>
<p>In other words, I need to feel motivation for actions that are <em>even more boring</em> than “saving for retirement” (who wants to do that? boring!) or “flossing everyday”. This is a hard problem.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, that’s it. Motivation for doing truckloads of Deliberate Practice, hard study, original thinking, working outside of your Comfort zone, and doing What Needs to be Done. Plus, Keeping your Focus.</p>
<p>What is <em>not</em> included above? Being able to do any activity no matter how boring it is. Nope. Being able to do <em>all</em> the items on your To-Do List (should be doable for a true master) - but nope. Being able to do all the errands I procrastinate on - nope. We let the dishes pile up if need be, we tolerate slightly poor exercise regimens.</p>
<p>We are not looking for all-round Increase-Motivation-for-Anything powers here. Just the power to increase motivation for a few things we care about.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="identifying-skills">Identifying Skills</h1>
<p>So how do we identify the skills that will get us the Impact we want?</p>
<h2 id="case-study-cricket-batsman">Case Study: Cricket Batsman</h2>
<p><strong>Desired Impact</strong>: Want to hit boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>Breaking it down</strong>: We can hit boundaries on the off-side, leg-side, behind the wicketkeeper, and straight down the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Skills</strong>:</p>
<p>What skills can I use to hit boundaries on the off-side? Cover drive, cut shot, etc.</p>
<p>What skills can I use to hit boundaries on the leg-side? Pull, hook, sweep, etc.</p>
<p>Behind the wicketkeeper? Dil-scoop, upar cut, etc.</p>
<p>Straight down the ground? Straight drive and so on.</p>
<p>Cool. We now have to Deliberate Practice each of these skills in isolation. Done.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="reverse-engineer-and-re-create">Reverse-Engineer and Re-Create</h1>
<p>Once you break the big-ass Impact into specific little Impacts, you can easily identify the skills that can get you there.</p>
<p>Look at people who are great at getting that Impact and then tease out the specific skills they use to get it. <strong>Identify the masters and ask - How did they do it?</strong></p>
<p>For example, Ganguly gets a lot of his boundaries on the off-side. How does he do it? Lots of cuts and cover drives. Cool. I’ll have some of that. Sachin gets lots of fours down the ground. How does he do it? Straight drive. Awesome.</p>
<p>The point is to reverse-engineer the skills of the experts so well that, given enough time and data and resources, you should be able to <em>re-create</em> their performance. You should be able to get to their skill level and get the results they get. That is the true test for whether you have captured the essence of their mastery.</p>
<p>For the sciences, say, your aim is to get such a good grasp of their skills so that, given the data or resources that the scientists in that field possess, you should be able to derive all the important results they have got. For example, if you care about physics, then you should get such a good grasp of the scientific method that you would be able to derive stuff like gravity, laws of motion, thermodynamics, etc. from the necessary data without peeking at the textbook derivation.</p>
<p>If that seems daunting or impossible, we have to put things in historical perspective - <em>everything</em> was a brand-new mystery once upon a time. There was nothing magical about what Newton did or what Galileo did or what Einstein did. We live in a Merely Real World - no magic. All the mystery is in our heads. They applied some specific skills to get the results they got. Maybe the skills are too complex or too resource-intensive for us average people to master, but we need to accept first that they are just skills. It is doable in theory.</p>
<p>Let’s try to reverse-engineer the skills for Truth and Motivation.</p>
<h1 id="identifying-skills-truth">Identifying Skills: Truth</h1>
<p><strong>Desired Impact</strong>: High Predictive Power</p>
<p><strong>Breaking it down</strong>: Knowledge about human mind, body, psychology; Money, Math, and Measurements.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: We don’t want to learn the concepts themselves (Impact), we want to learn <em>how</em> people got to the concepts (Skill). That is what we need to become good at.</p>
<p>Plus, the Skill must directly lead to the Impact. It can’t be vague.</p>
<p><strong>Skills</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What skills do I need for understanding human psychology and motivation better?</p>
<p>The Impact I want is to predict my own behaviour and predict other people’s behaviour. What skills will help me do that?</p>
<p>Look at the people who are best able to predict their own motivation patterns and those of others. Identify their skills.</p>
<hr />
<p>Which people are good at understanding human psychology? Psychologists, I suppose.</p>
<p>How do they do it? Some of them use the Scientific Method rigorously. I’ve heard that Freudian guys (psychoanalysts) didn’t use it much. Again, they must have special tricks for running experiments on humans.</p>
<hr />
<p>Which people are good at understanding how motivation works? Motivation researchers. I don’t know if that’s a separate field or just part of Psychology. They too use the Scientific Method.</p>
<p>Also, I understand there’s a field called Automaticity that studies powerful, unconscious motivations.</p>
<p>What about people who are great at generating motivation in themselves and in others? They probably understand how motivation works, right? They have good Predictive power. Who are these guys?</p>
<p>It’s worth looking at Motivational Speakers for this. Maybe great leaders who inspire others to work hard. Generals of armies. Marathon runners and mountain-climbers, maybe. They do keep going past limits where others would give up. How do they do it?</p>
<p>In other words, who are the people who <em>don’t give up</em> even in trying circumstances? How do they keep at it? Who are the people who <em>persist</em> in things way after ordinary mortals would have thrown in the towel?</p>
<p>That was long-term Motivation - sticking to something for years or whatever, without giving up.</p>
<p>What about medium-term stuff? People who put in long hours everyday on some task without complaining? How do they feel like doing it? Programmers do it effortlessly. So do gamers. Ditto for addicts. I’m only half-joking here. Seriously, they too are humans. How do ordinary humans with ordinary human brains end up spending the whole day / night drinking, or gambling, or watching porn or whatever? There must be something interesting (even if unhealthy) going on there. If we can remove the unhealthy part, we have hit the jackpot.</p>
<p>Then, there’s the short-term stuff - people who don’t run away from stuff in the moment. How are some people able to think scary thoughts without exploding? Most people in the world just ignore ideas that seem too hard for them, even if they actually have a chance of doing it and even if these are the most important things they could be doing. PG calls this Big Problem Blindness or something. The fishing is best where the fewest go, but there is a reason why so few go there. It’s super-scary. Standing your ground and not avoiding the real problems is another skill. Who has done that in the past? Who has dared to think great thoughts and face down “impossible” problems without flinching? TODO</p>
<p>Just like it takes courage to not run away from the real problems, it takes courage to run <em>towards</em> the real problems, to inch towards actions that you <em>need</em> to take, but don’t feel like taking. Who makes the choices that no one else can make? (Batman!) Who takes uncomfortable actions in the moment? (Startup guys, stunt people, pick-up artists)</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: We don’t want to get the actual motivation-generation skills here. We want to know what these people <em>understood</em> about the human motivation process that allowed them to do these awe-inspiring things.</p>
<p>aka What are the <strong>Laws of Motivation</strong> that these people are leveraging?</p>
<p>How did they discover these principles? How did they come to know what to do to generate motivation in themselves and in others? Those are the skills we want to master.</p>
<p>Reference: the long, medium, short term distinctions for motivation are from Eliezer’s post on solving hard problems.</p></li>
<li><p>What skills do I need for knowing more about how to make money?</p>
<p>Technically, it’s more about creating wealth.</p>
<p>Who’s really good at knowing how to creating wealth? People who have made money (though they might not be aware of the process that took them there). People who study this stuff rigorously - economics researchers?</p>
<p>For example, people who study startups should have a good idea of how they made money. (Then, why aren’t they rich themselves? Cos the actual work might be too costly - would require full dedication and hard work and lots of emotional atyaachaar. And maybe some brilliance.) Paul Graham is one such person, though he has figured out how to make money from this knowledge (see: YCombinator).</p>
<p>Finance stuff, maybe? Investment would probably be a huge part of wealth-creation, too. Maybe financial researchers would have important things to say about how to make money (though, again, it might be very costly / painful to actually do the stuff - else, why aren’t they rich?).</p>
<p>These seem to be the major ways to wealth in our economy. Maybe some other stuff like entertainment (movies, novels, music) or art or whatever could lead to wealth. I dunno. Maybe they’re too unreliable or too difficult? Worth checking out. Of course, power and corruption are time-honoured routes to wealth - but I’m not going down there.</p>
<p>So, learn about the key skills people have identified for the above ways to wealth, and then practice them.</p></li>
<li><p>What skills will help me solve problems in Discrete Math, Probability Theory, etc. (and do it quickly)?</p>
<p>Who’s really good at solving math problems? Math geniuses.</p>
<p>How do they do it? What are the skills they use?</p>
<p>I don’t know off the top of my head, but I guess there will be books out there which describe such math skills in detail. Those are the skills I need to practice.</p></li>
<li><p>What skills do I need for knowing how to measure stuff?</p>
<p>Who’s really good at this? People who measure stuff professionally. I have an epic book called “How to Measure Anything” by Douglas Hubbard. He is a master in this field.</p>
<p>He has basically written down <em>how</em> he can measure anything you give him. He has become aware of the skills (he teaches people how to measure stuff) and listed them out. That’s what I want. I think it will be good enough for my purposes if I can focus on just the skills specified in that book.</p></li>
<li><p>What skills will help me research my ideas better?</p>
<p>Who are some masters at researching ideas? Researchers, I guess :P.</p>
<p>What skills do they use? I’m sure they would have written about it somewhere. I need to practice those skills.</p></li>
<li><p>What skills will help me see better what needs to be done?</p>
<p>Who are the masters of knowing what needs to be done? Advanced Epistemic Rationalists.</p>
<p>How do they do it? They use math to replace faulty intuitions and look into the future to see the consequences of our actions. Basically, counter Scope Insensitivity and High-Delay Blindness. They have come up with some skills and techniques to do that. I need to master those techniques.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="identifying-skills-motivation">Identifying Skills: Motivation</h1>
<p><strong>Desired Impact</strong>: High Motivation for High Value stuff</p>
<p><strong>Breaking it down</strong>: Motivation for Deliberate Practice, hard study, original thinking, working outside my Comfort zone, and keeping high focus.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: We don’t want to get the motivation itself (Impact), we want to learn <em>how</em> to get the motivation (Skill). That is what we need to become good at.</p>
<p><strong>Skills</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What skills do I need for having the motivation to do lots of Deliberate Practice?</p>
<p>Who are the master at this? The people who have proved it by doing lots of Deliberate Practice. We need to know how they did it.</p>
<p>Daniel Coyle, in The Talent Code, talks about how great achievers become passionate about some field. He calls this Ignition. He has helpfully reverse-engineered the skills for us. I think it will be good enough for my purposes if I take on the Ignition skills he lists in his book.</p></li>
<li><p>What skills do I need for having the motivation to study hard?</p>
<p>Who are masters at studying some subject hard? People who have consistently done so for years.</p>
<p>How do they do it?</p>
<p>Love for the subject is my hypothesis. But that’s too broad and unhelpful when it comes to the day-to-day, moment-to-moment challenges. What else do they do to keep themselves motivated?</p>
<p>I’ve heard that goal-setting is helpful (don’t laugh - we can’t assume something is helpful just because we “found it to be helpful” in our lives. It needs to be backed by scientific evidence).</p>
<p>I’m sure researchers somewhere have identified the skills required to keep focussed on your study task and do a lot of it. Plus, I need specific skills for being motivated about math studies. Need to practice those skills.</p></li>
<li><p>What skills will help me have the motivation to think originally about topics?</p>
<p>I need to be able to research things for myself, discover ideas on my own. That’s hard work. Where do I find the motivation for that?</p>
<p>Who are masters at having the motivation to think originally a lot?</p>
<p>Inventors? Writers (fiction and non-fiction)? Philosophers? Fashion designers? Anybody who routinely looks at the world in different ways.</p>
<p>Wait. Is this about “Creativity”? Or “Innovation”? Well, definitely about Innovation. I’m not sure about the Creativity bit, but whatever.</p>
<p>I’m sure there are books describing what keeps Innovators ticking. Need to practice those skills.</p></li>
<li><p>What skills do I need for working outside my Comfort zone?</p>
<p>Who are some masters of working outside their Comfort zone?</p>
<p>Novelty-seekers - they push themselves to do new things everyday. Stuntmen - they can’t be totally immune to fear, right? Public speakers? People who do Dares?</p>
<p>How do they do that?</p>
<p>Remember, the doing part itself might not be too complicated. It’s about the getting yourself to do it part.</p>
<p>Have to look up on the research on acting outside your comfort zone and expanding your comfort zone. They would have identified the skills required to push yourself past resistance.</p></li>
<li><p>What skills will help me do What Needs to be Done?</p>
<p>This isn’t about finding out what to do, this is about actually getting yourself motivated enough to do it.</p>
<p>Who are masters at doing What Needs to be Done? People who are working in High Impact areas even if they aren’t getting immediate rewards or anything. They are doing it solely because it Needs to be Done.</p>
<p>How do they do it? How does Batman do it? How does he make the choice no one else can make?</p>
<p>I have to look into this a bit more. For now, I guess techniques that make the Impact more real to you will help get you into action.</p></li>
<li><p>What skills do I need for keeping high focus on some activity?</p>
<p>Who are masters of keeping high focus on something, and staying away from temptations and stuff?</p>
<p>Religious ascetics come to mind easily - they abstain from all kinds of human temptations - sex, alcohol, tasty food, wealth, etc. And they keep focussed on their chanting or meditation for hours.</p>
<p>How do they do that?</p>
<p>Programmers and mathematicians and people in other intensive fields are no less praiseworthy. They too keep their focus for hours on end. Hmmm… This reminds me of the idea of Flow where High Skill meets High Challenge and thus your mind is completely occupied by something, with no attention left to think about anything else. The Flow researchers could point us to useful skills.</p>
<p>About staying away from temptations and distractions, I’m sure the Will Power researchers have much to say about the skills required. I have this book called “The Will Power Instinct” by Kelly McGonigall. It’s accessible and practical. I’ll stick to just the skills in this book for now.</p></li>

<h1 id="real-world-tests">Real-World Tests</h1>
<p>Now, I can use these as Real-World Tests for my skills. If at any time, I want to see just how much I have progressed, I can take on a mini-challenge from these areas and see how well I’ve done. It’s the equivalent of taking a practical exam in some course.</p>
<h1 id="design-and-implementation">Design and Implementation</h1>
<p>We want Design and Implementation to evolve together. Just like language developers develop a language alongside a major project in that language. That way you can discover what you really need to have in the language and can keep changing it with the aim of making it a better language for that project.</p>
<p>It’s the same way with a Skill and a Project. Try to do the project using the current skill. See where it is lacking. Go and patch the skill so that that flaw is fixed. Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>We can pick interesting mini-projects from these domains and use them to guide our skill development.</p>
<h1 id="getting-practical-feedback">Getting practical feedback</h1>
<p>We want cheap and quick feedback if want to use it in Deliberate Practice.</p>
<h1 id="the-most-important-requirement">The Most Important Requirement</h1>
<p>Feedback.</p>
<p>Without this, everything else is useless. You can have the most brilliant ideas about how to practice the shit out of some skill, but it will all go to nought if you don’t have feedback.</p>
<p>You need feedback to keep yourself motivated, first and foremost. Remember that “Delay” factor in the denominator of the Motivation Equation? When you don’t get feedback right away, the Delay is very high. Which means, your Motivation is very low. Which means you ain’t gonna be doing much more of that activity.</p>
<p>Next, feedback is crucial for information. You need to know whether you’re doing it right or not. Should you keep doing it this way or should you change it a bit? How should you change it? How much should you change it? You need feedback for this.</p>
<h1 id="concretely-speaking">Concretely Speaking</h1>
<p>What exactly do I mean by Feedback?</p>
<p>I mean some sort of measurement of our performance. We need something that gives us quick feedback, hopefully instantly and continuously.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the problem in more detail.</p>
<p>What are some examples of feedback mechanisms that people use during practice?</p>
<p>Bowlers practicing in the nets can see where the ball pitched and by how much it missed the stumps.</p>
<p>Batsman practicing in the nets can see whether they hit the ball or not, and can feel where they hit it on the bat, and which direction it went in.</p>
<p>People practicing an instrument have a feel in their head for the piece they are trying to play. They have heard the original before and are comparing their own performance against the tune in their head.</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>What about the rest of the ideas? What about Bayes Theorem? It doesn’t figure anywhere above. Shouldn’t you try to master using it?</p>
<p>Well, how would you use it? Using Bayes Theorem directly on complex problems is still not a well-understood technique (afaik). We can use it on simple problems, but using it in full generality requires a lot of computing power because the hypotheses get more and more complex.</p>
<p>There should probably be a way to use some restricted form of Bayes Theorem usefully. I dunno what that is.</p>
<p>So, it’s a research problem. It is not yet a clear-cut, well-understood skill that you can Deliberate Practice.</p></li>

<li><p>I want to gain predictive power about how to make money. Who doesn’t? What are good ways to do so in the current economy?</p>
<p>I’m not saying I want to do this, but I might need to go down this road in the future. (What exactly would I do with the money? Coming soon.)</p></li>

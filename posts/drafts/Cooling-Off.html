<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What should we cool off about?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="walk-a-mile-in-your-own-shoes">Walk a mile… in your own shoes</h1>
<p>They say that when you’re really angry with some other person, you should walk a mile in their shoes before you do anything against them. Basically, you need to understand what was really going on in their mind and why they were behaving in such a fucked up manner.</p>
<p>This isn’t about other people.</p>
<p>You get an awesome idea. You think about it and you get more and more excited with every minute. It is such an awesome idea. You work yourself up into a frenzy. You even write an essay about it. And, as things go with essays, you end up generating even more awesome insights about the topic and get convinced how awesome it is.</p>
<p>What should you do?</p>
<p>Analyze your life’s actions and re-arrange them in light of this new epiphany?</p>
<p>Or walk a mile in your own shoes?</p>
<h1 id="wtf">WTF?</h1>
<p>So, there are these times when I have a buttload of ideas unloaded on me out of nowhere by my unconscious. I’ve written about one time when I wasn’t able to sleep because of the stuff that was hitting me between the eyes (Portrait).</p>
<p>I had a similar epiphany shower last night. (I had just watched the new X-Men movie, if that is relevant here.)</p>
<p>You live through your normal life and you do normal stuff. The reason, I think, why hard-hitting stuff hits you so hard is because you spend so much time setting up cushions around you in your daily life. Routine. Normalcy. Protection against shocks.</p>
<p>We probably might not even be able to take a constant barrage of epiphanies and strokes of whatever. Would be overload.</p>
<p>Anyway. these seem to happen when you’re doing something out of the ordinary. I mean, it would be pretty weird if you’re just doing normal everyday stuff and you realize, “Oh, yeah…”… (I dunno about this)</p>
<p>So, what is really going on in your head when you have all these epiphanies and stuff?</p>
<p>And why is it that they don’t really seem to have the impact we hope they will have?</p>
<hr />
<p>What came of my Portrait insight? In that essay, I had finally realized the completely wrong direction I was going with this website. I was making deep plans for making this a great teaching resource for “rationality” and for spreading “life-changing ideas” in a persuasive way so that people would actually change their lives. With that essay, I realized that nobody should listen to me (because I hadn’t achieved anything with all the “awesome” ideas I had) and that, therefore, the most important function of this website would be to make me stronger. Everything else came later.</p>
<p>Well, it’s been a month now. Looking back, I can say that, yeah, I have changed course. Maybe not completely, but I’m completely off the “spread awesome ideas” track. It took an essay or two more for it to sink in, but it did.</p>
<hr />
<p>I think I’ve had one or two valuable insights in almost every essay I’ve written so far. Some of the essays have been absolute crap because I was writing them for others. But, apart from that, I’ve had genuine ideas.</p>
<p>What came of them? I even added so-called “Keep It Real” actions at the end of many of them? Did I follow up on even a few?</p>
<p>Why is it that many of them didn’t really have an impact? More importantly, why didn’t I predict that? The problem isn’t that they didn’t have much of an impact. It took me a while, but I’ve finally come to terms with the fact that “Rationality”, as it stands, hasn’t really done too much for me (or for anyone else) [Link].</p>
<p>So, the lack of Impact isn’t the real problem. It’s the hope I had. I genuinely felt that it would improve my life in some way. It made me feel good and stuff. But nothing came of it. And every time this happens, my faith in myself drops one more notch. It damning evidence for my mind which starts to think I’m an utter fuck-tard who is incapable of executing on even the most easy and awesome of ideas. Not cool.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<h1 id="cleaning-the-blackboard">Cleaning the blackboard</h1>
<p>Imagine you’re a Math teacher in high school. You come to class one day and teach the kids about - I don’t know - algebra or something. You write out two or three major theorems on the board and also solve some problems on the board so that they can understand. At the end of the hour, you say your goodbye and leave, telling them that you will pick it up from that spot tomorrow. You see the Physics teacher comes in next.</p>
<p>You come back to class the next day, hoping to use one of the theorems you wrote on the board.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey! Where are the theorems I wrote on the board yesterday? They’re gone!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well. The Physics teacher probably wiped the blackboard so that he could use it.</p>
<hr />
<p>You think furiously about an idea the whole day and go to bed still thinking about it. You write down stuff about it. You think of ways in which it will improve your life and stuff. All is well so far.</p>
<p>Then, the next day, you have to go to work or college or whatever. Life happens. A couple of days pass. You’re a little busy.</p>
<p>Then, you catch some free time again. You revisit the awesome idea you had.</p>
<p>But now, something’s wrong. Something is missing.</p>
<p>It doesn’t make as much sense any more. I mean, it is there. And you guess the individual pieces do sort of make sense. But, when you put them together, they don’t quite add up to the awesome Dragon you thought you had constructed last week. It seems like a good idea, but nothing life-changing.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>I think what happened is that you lost context. Your mind’s blackboard was wiped away.</p>
<p>You may have stored down the key points in a notebook. Those remain. But everything else, the surrounding thoughts, the examples that were at a hand’s reach on that day, the feelings that made it so real and so huge that you could practically see it in front of your eyes… all of them are gone.</p>
<p>It’s like a movie shooting spot after the shooting is over. It is completely deserted, more so in contrast with how alive it was a few hours ago. All the awesome lights are gone, the music is gone, the buzzing people are gone, everything is gone. What is left is the shooting spot. It is still beautiful, just not quite as great as it was made to look when the shooting was on.</p>
<p>Certain things make sense in a certain context. When you go inside a casino or a strip club, there ain’t gonna be a single thought about your pending homework or whatever. Your mind will just be saying “Go go go!!!”.</p>
<h1 id="initial-excitement">Initial excitement</h1>
<p>It’s not like the stuff that is wiped off your mind’s blackboard was all The Divine Truth that you have now forever lost.</p>
<p>Most probably, what it was feelings overcoming your mind and making the idea seem more awesome than it is, more logical than it is, and more life-changing than it is.</p>
<p>Like insights or enlightenment that people have when they are on drugs - most probably delusion. There’s nothing you can tell them to convince them that they’re just having silly visualizations in a state of mind where they are prone to take it as truth.</p>
<p>In other words, epiphanies are like girls (for boys) - you can’t think straight around them. Any decision you take in their presence must now be <a href="http://hpmor.com/chapter/55">considered suspect, fallacious until proven valid</a>.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-left">What is left</h1>
<p>The truth is what is left after you’ve taken out all the crap.</p>
<p>Accept the truth. Embrace it. That is all there is in the world.</p>
<p>The only thing you can reliably trust is the data.</p>
<p>It may seem awesome in the moment, but you will come crashing down to reality after midnight with nothing to show for it, like Cinderella (make it subtle).</p>
<p>You’ve just had an epiphany? Great. Think about it at depth. Write an essay while everything is still fresh.</p>
<p>Then, Cool Off. Take a couple of days to go do other stuff (life will do this for you). Come back after a couple of days, preferably a week.</p>
<p>How does that “epiphany” look now?</p>
<h1 id="v0.5">v0.5</h1>
<p>Yup. I started writing all this to just get some basic theory out there and introduce v0.5 of The Great 300-Word Experiment.</p>
<p>Posts with editing. Write post. Cool off. Come back. Edit it. Publish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rewriting is the essence of writing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was what I wanted to say. But, given that I’m not writing here to please others or to convince them or to even spread knowledge, that seemed a bit hollow. I am here <em>only</em> to generate ideas. The more the better. The better the better. Nothing more, nothing less. Publishing online is mainly so that I am forced to explain clearly.</p>
<p>Rewriting seems like good advice for people who write novels or magazine articles or non-fiction books or whatever. I dunno. Paul Graham does lots and lots of rewriting, apparently. He has an insanely awesome article about how he does it. (Version 1.0)</p>
<p>But, I wasn’t convinced it would be useful for generating ideas, which the only thing we care about here.</p>
<p>Then, it struck me. The rewriting part here is more to introduce Cooling Off than anything else. Perspective. When you write an essay and come back to read it after a week, for all practical purposes, it ain’t your essay anymore. It is written by somebody else. The data bears me out. I am routinely surprised by stuff I wrote even after just four days.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ve had a nice epiphany. I had a lot of ideas about how I’m usually misguided when I’m having epiphanies…. wait a minute! Can I trust my thoughts right now? How do I know what is right? Only time will tell.</p>
<h1 id="ps">PS</h1>
<p>Fuck! I didn’t mean to think about epiphanies like that. No! I like epiphanies. I want to have them.</p>
<p>I want my epiphanies! I want them!!! Give me my epiphanies… don’t take my epiphanies away from me… they’re so nice… and blissful… and life feels awesome when I have them… it feels like I will finally be able to solve all my problems once and for all… and get rid of all the pain and suffering I have in this motherfucking world… Give me back my epiphanies…. Give it to me…</p>
<p>(SPK is forced by a couple of guards into a strait-jacket and put in an isolation chamber)</p>

<p><strong>Entry Question</strong>: How do we get rid of Confusion about some topic?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="why-should-you-want-to-resolve-confusions">Why should you <em>want</em> to Resolve Confusions?</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>More Predictive Power means more Win.</p></li>
<li><p>Confusion means you’re getting lower Predictive Power than you think you should.</p>
<p>Worse, you don’t even realize it.</p>
<p>Here, we will see how to Notice Confusion - places where you don’t actually know as much as you think you do. Now, you will be able to see the places where you actually suck.</p>
<p>Then, we will see how to Resolve Confusion, so that you can know more and thus Win.</p></li>
<li><p>Without knowing that Confusions are not in the Territory and are only in your Map, you won’t even realize that your problem can be solved and understood. You will think that your problem is impenetrable.</p>
<p>When you learn about Confusions, you will realize that either your problem has a solution or there exists a proof that it is impossible to solve. One or the other. But, you will know either way.</p>
<p>You won’t sit around with a false understanding.</p>
<p>This will give you hope and the energy to take action on the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>When you are Confused, you won’t even realize what the events in the Territory are.</p>
<p>You think you know all the events, but actually there are many events you don’t know about, for which you consequently make very poor predictions (more or less random predictions or whatever the human default behaviour is).</p>
<p>i.e., You don’t know all the various scenarios that your solution must handle. Your solution doesn’t handle all the problem requirements. Naturally, if you don’t design your solution to handle those scenarios, you’re most probably gonna suck over there. No magic fairy is gonna bail you out.</p></li>
<li><p>When you are Confused, you won’t be able to make accurate predictions about important events</p>
<p>You won’t have the deep models you need to make precise and accurate predictions.</p></li>
<li><p>When you are Confused, you won’t be able to update on evidence and learn usefully from experience</p>
<p>So, learn how to Notice and Resolve Confusion. Else, you’ll go to Bayesian Hell.</p></li>
<li><p>When you are Confused, you won’t be able to tell what was the cause of the outcomes that you see in life</p>
<p>How will you fix things if you don’t know what caused the problem in the first place?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, you’re Confused when you think your problem is completely impenetrable and confusing, when you are getting poorer results than you think you should, when you don’t know all the events that your solution must handle, when you aren’t able to make accurate predictions about the events, when you aren’t able to improve performance even after getting lots of evidence, or when you aren’t able to tell the cause of some particular observation and thus aren’t able to fix things.</p>
<h1 id="beliefs-must-pay-rent">Beliefs must pay Rent</h1>
<p>Belief = Anticipation Constraint</p>
<p>Beliefs must pay rent = Beliefs must increase Predictive Power</p>
<p>Otherwise, throw them out</p>
<p>I fell for the password. I didn’t really make the connection between anticipation-control and increasing Predictive Power.</p>
<p>Increasing Predictive Power = Putting more probability mass on the correct outcomes AND putting LESS probability mass on the wrong outcomes</p>
<p>The second part is the crucial one, the one we usually miss. This is why Beliefs must constrain anticipation is such a mind-opener.</p>
<p>Note, however, that anticipation-constraints are not sufficient to increase Predictive Power. They must also be correct.</p>
<p>Predictive Power (aka Rent) = Correct Anticipation Constraint</p>
<h1 id="confusion-beliefs-that-dont-pay-rent-but-seem-like-they-do">Confusion = Beliefs that don’t pay rent (but seem like they do)</h1>
<p>This is how the Map can end up not reflecting the Territory</p>
<p>When you have confusion, you have labels in your Map that don’t do anything. They don’t constrain the events in the Territory.</p>
<p>They just seem to represent that Territory and feel like satisfying explanations.</p>
<p>So, you think you’ve got a model of that territory (i.e., something that constrains anticipation for those events), but you actually don’t</p>
<p>And so, when you ask it to generate some predictions (anticipation controls), you get a blank response!</p>
<p>And when you try to improve the model, you find that it has no moving parts, so you can’t make any progress.</p>
<p>You are confused.</p>
<p>Basically, whole parts of your model that make no anticipation-constraints, but which SEEM like they do. And they have no simpler moving parts, so you can’t make progress.</p>
<p>So, you can’t make useful predictions when you face events - You are confused.</p>
<p>You can’t improve your predictions based on evidence - You are confused.</p>
<p>You just add on some more non-rent-paying labels (“The rod is hot BECAUSE…”)</p>
<h1 id="the-map-with-just-names">The Map with just Names</h1>
<p>Basically, you just have names for the various parts of the Territory in your Map.</p>
<p>But that’s all.</p>
<p>No mountains, no rivers, nothing about the actual terrain.</p>
<p>Just “this place is called Akrasia”. “This place is called Intelligence”.</p>
<p>That would be fine if you used that name to get more details from other people and fill in the Map. (aka read some books on the topic or talk to other people)</p>
<p>But, you use it as a proper Map itself. It is a Curiosity-Stopper for you.</p>
<p>“That’s it. I know about the place called Akrasia.”</p>
<p>What do you know?</p>
<p>“It’s called Akrasia.”</p>
<p>What else? What is over here on this spot?</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Also, because of Naive Realism, you think that the reality is as confusing as your Map of it.</p>
<p>Ok. How can we find out more about this spot?</p>
<p>“No. You can’t. It’s a very difficult Big Problem. It will take a huge number of insights to know what’s going on down there.”</p>
<p>It seems confusing and unknowable to you, so you think it IS confusing and unknowable. Or, at least, very difficult to know.</p>
<h1 id="consequences-of-confusion">Consequences of Confusion</h1>
<p>You can’t predict: You have no anticipation-controlling things in your mind for the events. You just stand there confused.</p>
<p>Potential Test for Confusion: You won’t be able to make any (quantitative?) predictions!</p>
<p>You will just stand there with a blank expression. Nothing will come. There is no machinery below that lever in your mind.</p>
<p>You can’t update: You have nothing to falsify or strengthen on the basis of evidence, cos nothing made predictions either way.</p>
<p>What do you do when something goes against your anticipation and you notice it?</p>
<p>You just throw in another label to “explain” that particular outcome.</p>
<p>Or, you stretch your existing labels to be able to “explain” that outcome</p>
<p>Can be only one of the above :P</p>
<p>Potential Test: You won’t be able to improve your model usefully.</p>
<p>You can add more symbols, but you won’t see the implication of those concepts put together.</p>
<p>You can’t do Backward Inference: When the teacher asks, why it’s hot, you can’t give any actual causes. You just Guess the Teacher’s Password (“it’s hot BECAUSE… of heat conduction”). You bring up labels that you have heard of in the past and put in your Map.</p>
<h1 id="what-causes-confusion">What causes Confusion?</h1>
<p>What causes us to have Confusion? Why don’t we throw out the beliefs that don’t pay rent? Why did they enter in the first place?</p>
<p>Curiosity-stopper</p>
<p>Naive Realism - You think that reality itself is that confusing and that there is no answer, no way to correctly predict the outcomes.</p>
<p>Test: If you have Confusion without Naive Realism, you will dispel the Confusion very soon.</p>
<p>i.e., if you believe that your Map is different from the Territory, you will try to figure out where your beliefs are lacking and try to fix them or throw them away.</p>
<p>Test: If you are Confused and not making progress, you must be falling prey to Naive Realism</p>
<p>All the stuff that keeps Naive Realism going - Confirmation Bias, etc.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-notice-confusion">How to Notice Confusion</h1>
<p>Before you get some sort of information or answer from others, Predict</p>
<p>Don’t fit your model to the answer somehow</p>
<p>Don’t try to explain it somehow</p>
<p>Just admit that you are confused</p>
<p>The general situation: You think you have a correct model but something happens that contradicts your anticipation. You now don’t think that your model is wrong. You just try to do some mental gymnastics to make your prediction fit the outcome, WITHOUT changing your model.</p>
<p>aka: “The rod is hotter BECAUSE…” followed by a meaningless sequence of words.</p>
<h2 id="example-the-hot-rod-and-the-physics-students">Example: The hot rod and the physics students</h2>
<p>The teacher asks you <em>why</em> this is so</p>
<p>Loaded question</p>
<p>Ask her if the rod has been near the fire for long</p>
<p>If so, you have NO explanations for why it is cold at that end</p>
<p>In other words, Predict what you should have seen</p>
<h1 id="mysterious-answer">Mysterious Answer</h1>
<p>What is a Mysterious Answer?</p>
<p>[Link to Eliezer]</p>
<p>Not having any moving parts is a Mysterious Answer Smell</p>
<p>I think because you have no way of making predictions apart from the predictions that came along with the black box.</p>
<p>You could have black boxes that pay some rent (predictive power) but about whose insides you don’t know. As long as you realize that it is possible for you to understand what is inside, it’s not a problem. Maybe the amount of predictive power it gives you is sufficient for your purposes.</p>

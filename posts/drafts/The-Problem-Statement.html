<p><strong>Entry Question</strong>: What is the most important thing you can do when trying to crack a Hard Problem?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="what-would-the-solution-look-like">What would the Solution look like?</h1>
<p>Without knowing the solution itself, can I describe what kind of solution people expect from me?</p>
<p>For example, for Akrasia, if I give you a box saying that the solution is within it, what will make you think that this is not the solution?</p>
<p>Will you expect it to be a pill that will rid you of “Akrasia” forever?</p>
<p>Well, what if I give you sheet of paper with a plan written on it, saying that the plan will get rid of much of your Akrasia?</p>
<p>Will you deny it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How will you find what you’re looking for if you don’t even know what it is?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are your Anticipation Constraints (aka Beliefs) about the solution?</p>
<h1 id="the-problem-statement">The Problem Statement</h1>
<p>I’m inspired mostly by the problem statements I found for technical problems, such as those in programming contests. There was a very clear description of the input and the expected output and what the output was for an input. It was, in fact, so unambiguous that the competitions used computer programs to judge your entry.</p>
<p>Real life is much more messy, I think. We can’t use a computer program to judge our solutions right now. But it doesn’t mean there is no judge. You have a program running in your head. You can use that judge your solution.</p>
<p>Your problem statement doesn’t have to unambiguous and precise enough for a computer program, just unambiguous enough for you to carry out a search effectively.</p>
<p>The Problem Statement tells you the Anticipation Constraints for the Solution.</p>
<h1 id="solving-problems">“Solving Problems”</h1>
<p>Ok. All that’s fine. Beliefs backed up by evidence. No Naive Realism. High Prediction Score. High Impact, in other words.</p>
<p>How do you solve a new problem?</p>
<p>Taboo: “solve”, “problem”</p>
<p>How do you discover how to get a certain Impact?</p>
<p>Taboo: “discover how to get”</p>
<p>How do you identify doable actions that will lead to a certain Impact?</p>
<p>Taboo: “actions”</p>
<p>Actions: sequence of moves in the language of that domain.</p>
<p>example: Bubble sort (array -&gt; sorted array)</p>
<p>Allowed moves in this domain would be: compare two elements, swap two elements, etc.</p>
<p>example: Cook Maggi noodles (Noodles + Masala + Water + Saucepan + Stove -&gt; Maggi Noodles)</p>
<p>Allowed moves in this domain would be: turn the stove on or off, wait, put stuff into the saucepan, stir, etc.</p>
<p>So, the original statement becomes:</p>
<p>How do you identify doable sequence of moves in the language of the domain that will lead to a certain Impact?</p>
<p>The complex, opaque notion of “problem-solving” has now been broken down into simpler moving parts. All glory be to Reductionism.</p>
<p>You can work on the language of the domain. Maybe you know all the moves you can take. But maybe there are some moves you haven’t considered (like, for example, batch-cooking some ingredients and storing them in the fridge and just re-heating them now). You can basically do the stuff you would do with a programming language - work with the <em>primitive</em> moves (turn stove on), <em>compose</em> them to form bigger moves (stir-fry chopped onions), <em>abstract</em> them to let you do complex stuff without worrying about all the underlying details (recipe for making a particular dish).</p>
<p>You can clarify the Impact you need. Maybe describe it in the language of the domain. Maybe break it down into independent pieces so that you can focus on each one in turn and get simpler solutions. Just like you break a complex program specification into mostly decoupled pieces (aka modularize the problem) and then solve them independently.</p>
<p>You can filter those sequences of moves that are doable. No way you’re gonna be able to a hundred big things one after the other in one minute as a newbie. Simultaneously, you can raise your level so that more things are doable. Basically, become better at that particular skill.</p>
<p>Maybe you should also list out the constraints. For example, in algorithm contests, the program has a time constraint - it can’t run longer than, say, 1 second on a specified machine. In programming, another constraint is the readability and extensibility of your code. Your code is gonna change, so make it easy to change. This eliminates potential programs that have 2000 lines of code in one C function. Same thing for memory usage.</p>
<p>Should you also list out the obstacles? Why specifically don’t you have the answer right now? What <em>exactly</em> is stopping you? What more would it take?</p>
<p>You can improve your ability to <em>search</em> for a sequence of moves that fits your need.</p>
<hr />
<p>The way I see it, I’ve basically drawn a parallel above between problem-solving and programming. Problem-solving is nothing but programming, in another domain.</p>
<p>But are they really isomorphic? Are there perhaps some cases where problem-solving is completely different from programming?</p>
<p>What if the number of primitive moves is too large? In programming, you have very few primitives - in a high-level language, you have conditionals, loops, functions, etc. In short, all the stuff described by the grammar of the language.</p>
<p>Find out if there exist cases where the analogy between problem-solving and programming is incorrect.</p>
<p>Because, otherwise, what it means is that we can transfer our programming techniques completely to the problem-solving world. Stuff like Rapid Prototyping, abstraction, decoupling, etc.</p>
<h1 id="complex-maps">Complex Maps?</h1>
<p>Also, if you have a Map that reflects the Territory a lot, is that all? Is it just enough to know all the concrete details about every part of the Territory?</p>
<p>Don’t you need to put those details into a meaningful model of the system? How else would you reason?</p>
<p>Say you know all the different events that are part of the Territory. And you have models for each one that tell you the right predictions. Is that a good Map? Or do you seek a Map that has less complexity?</p>
<p>Yo! The Complexity is taken care of by the priors. Complex hypotheses will find it hard to get to a high posterior probability. So, even if they make some predictions, they won’t have much weight cos of their low posterior probability. If, of course, a no simpler hypothesis makes the right predictions, then, of course, your final predictions (your Map) will be dominated by that hypothesis’ predictions.</p>
<h1 id="what-would-it-mean-to-be-not-confused-about-something">What would it mean to be not-confused about something?</h1>
<p>You would be able to predict its every move?</p>
<p>What would it mean to be not-confused about how to use Bayes Theorem in daily life?</p>
<p>I would know what to do at every step?</p>
<h1 id="technique">Technique</h1>
<p><em>Enumerate</em> the problems and the desired solutions in each instance.</p>
<p>Aka, talk about the different parts of the Territory - the events that the Territory is made up of.</p>
<h1 id="hard-and-exhausting">Hard and Exhausting</h1>
<p>It is incredibly hard to do this Thinking in terms of Impact thing. I <em>know</em> the answer is out there waiting for me to pluck it, but my mind resists me seeing past the appearance of things. It just wants to stick with the labels, like “Akrasia” and “confusing”. It doesn’t want to see through to the Territory.</p>
<p>Why is that? Why is it resisting something so useful and so obviously good?</p>
<p>The thought: “Just let it go.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: Hey, if I push a bit harder on this, if I follow this chain of tabooing, I will get through to the real answer…</p>
<p>Mind: Just let it go… yes… you can find the answer any time. Maybe some other day. For now, let’s just relaxxxxx…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s like Voldy’s Imperius. He’s telling me to just bow my head. Just bow and it will all be over. Just do it. But some other voice in my head is asking, “Why should I bow my head? I don’t think I want that. I’m gonna keep doing what I’m doing”. And then, he becomes more and more insistent.</p>
<h1 id="blindingly-obvious">Blindingly obvious</h1>
<p>Even kids know that what I did above - replacing symbol with substance - isn’t all that difficult. It’s no big deal.</p>
<p>It’s annoying, in fact. Like someone telling you something you already know. You feel like telling him, “Ok! Ok! I <em>got</em> that! Move on.”</p>
<p>But it’s not. It’s <em>not</em> something you “already know”. We judge something by its Impact. If you “already knew” about it, why didn’t you use that knowledge? For whatever reason, you hadn’t been thinking in those terms. You weren’t cutting through to the actual problem.</p>
<p>So, the lesson is that this will seem stupid and obvious, like anybody could do this. It seems like it doesn’t take any mad Rationality skillz to do this. What’s the point in it?</p>
<p>It seems like a cheap trick! I think we’re subconsciously looking for some epic awesome Rationality techniques that only the elitest of the elite can use. That way you would have a separate aura of awesomeness around you (exactly the way Einstein had, right?). People could easily see that you are a Rationalist beyond par. I mean, you can manipulate all these complex ideas in your head using these erudite techniques. No ordinary human could ever hope to master these. You are a god!</p>
<p>Whereas if the actual ways to succeed are based on simple techniques (maybe requiring hard work), then what’s the big deal in being a Rationalist? Anybody can do it, in principle. It would be like Luke Skywalker’s Force (in Eliezer’s whiny Luke version):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If guys like this could master the Force, then everybody in the galaxy would be using it. Cos it would be easier than getting a high school degree.</p>
<p>[get exact quote]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hard work using simple techniques isn’t as appealing as smug smart work using complex techniques.</p>
<p>Don’t overlook simple techniques just because they don’t seem sophisticated enough to be used by an Elite Rationalist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no honor in making it any harder than it has to be.</p>
<p>[get exact quote]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, we should favour simpler techniques over incredibly complex ones. You’re probably not gonna be able to squeeze the real juice out of the complex ones without a ton of practice. And, because it is so complex, you can’t even be sure before you start that it would actually even work. So, in the end, all that practice could have been for nothing. Simpler tools have them beat.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, my hypothesis is that my mind resists using such a simple and stupid technique like just replacing Symbol with Substance over and over again. It seems undignified and low-status, like doing manual labour - cutting trees with an axe or drilling stuff or laying bricks.</p>
<p>The task seems mindless and repetitive! It seems <em>boring</em> - public enemy number one for hackers.</p>
<p>Ah! No wonder I had such low Motivation for it. Apparently, it wasn’t challenging enough. I wasn’t using my strengths and skills.</p>
<p>I need to make it more Exciting for myself. Coming soon.</p>
<hr />
<p>I don’t think that’s all, though. I think there’s an element of fear here, too.</p>
<p>I think I was actually <em>scared</em> to push past my symbols and see the actual substance. I was afraid to figure out the actual problem and its concrete realities.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Hypothesis: Then, I would actually have to go and solve it.</p>
<p>Seeing the actual problem would increase my work load.</p>
<p>When a problem is abstract and vague, “Akrasia”, I can just sit around and mope saying that this such a Big Problem and how it will take years for me to solve it and how the current “Art of Rationality” isn’t good enough to solve the problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yo, bitch! [n00b vs master blaming Rationality quote]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could it be that I was trying to avoid <em>actually</em> working <em>hard</em> (as opposed to <em>writing</em> about working hard)?</p>
<p>But, I’m not averse to hard work. As a hacker, I <em>love</em> hard, challenging work. Nobody is into programming for the instant solutions.</p>
<p>Maybe this is hard work that seems to be above my level. Maybe I don’t think I can actually do it and that’s why I avoid it.</p>
<h1 id="why-we-dont-even-consider-certain-thoughts-and-actions">Why we don’t even consider certain thoughts and actions</h1>
<p>WAY TOO SCARY!</p>
<p>This is Fear of Failure on Steroids!</p>
<p>example: I was avoiding looking too hard ought the real problems I needed to solve - hard math, creating a startup, etc.</p>
<p>Even now, my mind wants to just write those words and quickly move on. I don’t even wanna acknowledge that I have the responsibility to solve those problems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[PG quote about Big Problems]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fuck, was PG ever right about the scariness of Big Problems. I’m shitting my pants.</p>
<p>They threaten my <em>sense of worth</em>, I guess. These problems are extremely threatening. They are like ultra-super-villains. I am <em>nothing</em> in front of them, right now.</p>
<p>Maybe this is what they call an Ugh Field.</p>
<p>Critical part of Thinking Original Thoughts - Face up to Really Scary Stuff.</p>
<h2 id="why-avoid-them">Why avoid them?</h2>
<p>Litany of Gendlin =&gt; You’re already enduring them.</p>
<p>Identify and adjacent the feelings inside you that are opposed by the Truth and are preventing you from seeing reality clearly.</p>
<p>example: unjustified pride or self-worth, thinking that I’m really intelligent and wanting to preserve that image, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Point</strong>: If I become low-status and low-value even in this field - Rationality - what will I be left with? What will I be?</p>
<p>Nothing? That’s my feeling. Rigorously test it with the Truth.</p>
<p>Mainly, you’re on the Way, doing the Right Things. You should be proud of yourself. Your Low self-esteem here is opposed by the Truth in the first place.</p>
<p>Now is when I need Eliezer’s Challenging the Difficult. I need to do the Impossible here. First, don’t run away. Begin to bind yourself to the problem.</p>

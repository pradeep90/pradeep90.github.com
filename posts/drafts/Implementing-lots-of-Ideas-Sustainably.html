<h1 id="the-limiting-factor">The Limiting Factor</h1>
<p>When we think of implementing lots of ideas in our life, we can intuitively feel that there is some sort of limitation, right? We just <em>know</em> that it is gonna go bust sooner or later. How come? What is the limitation?</p>
<p>Is it Will Power? Well, yes, but not always. As we’ve seen, if you’re opposing strong impulses, your finite Will Power will screw you. But, with other actions, it’s mostly just indirect impulses. So, Will Power shouldn’t be <em>that</em> much of a bottleneck. As I’m sitting here writing this essay, I don’t have a strong urge to shut off the laptop and not-write essays. There is no strong directly opposing force. (“SPK! Stop repeating stuff! We got it!”)</p>
<p>This suggests that it is motivation that is the real limiting factor here. I feel like doing something else. Maybe watching some movie. Or surfing the web aimlessly. Or eating. Whatever.</p>
<p>This means that, for fields other than stuff like obesity, addiction, etc., we need to design our “plans” keeping motivation in mind.</p>
<h1 id="what-else-goes-wrong">What else goes wrong?</h1>
<p>What else derails us when we try to implement lots of ideas?</p>
<p>I just tried to imagine what it would be like if I made a list of 15 skills from my website and tried to go about implementing them.</p>
<p>Look, you try too much, you’re gonna fail, ok? It’s a train crash waiting to happen.</p>
<p>And when it does, it is gonna feel really bad. Cos your self-worth and shit will be mixed up with your success and failure. You will feel like you suck.</p>
<p>I just <em>know</em> I’m gonna fail and it just knocks the wind out of my sails. This has <strong>never</strong> worked, as far as I know. Not for me, not for anybody else. Everybody has tons of ideas that they haven’t taken action on.</p>
<p>We need some sort of plan or set of actions that almost <strong>cannot</strong> fail! We need a very high expectancy of success initially.</p>
<p>(Advanced: Even if you do fail, you should fail spectacularly. It should be a Fun Failure. You should get the feeling that you have a lot of power and that because of a miscalculation you didn’t get the result. You should feel that you’re gonna kick its ass the next time! Instead of sitting on your butt crying about what a little bitch you are and how unsuccessful all your attempts have been.)</p>
<h1 id="keep-it-reeal-urvasi">Keep it Reeal, Urvasi!</h1>
<p>I was gonna go on and on talking about various ideas I have regarding motivation and how to implement ideas. But is that the best way to go forward? Is mentally jerking off the way forward?</p>
<p>Nope. I need to Keep it Real. I need to take Action right now.</p>
<p>My ideas don’t have to be perfect right now. They’re just v0.1 ideas, man.</p>
<h1 id="automaticity">Automaticity</h1>
<p>Do it so often and reward it so much that it becomes a habit. It becomes independent of motivation.</p>
<p>Composable solutions - do them in the right order and you won’t have to worry about the earlier ones because they would be taken care of… maybe refresh them once in a while, like Spaced Repetition</p>
<h1 id="less-hard">Less Hard</h1>
<p>Skill and motivation. Becomes less hard.</p>
<p>Skilled people have more fun.</p>
<p>Steve Yegge quote about skiers.</p>
<p>Flow. Not while you practice, but when you use your skill.</p>
<h1 id="motivation-equation">Motivation Equation</h1>
<h1 id="versions">Versions</h1>
<p>Have a basic version 1.0</p>
<h1 id="that-is-an-order">That is an Order!</h1>
<p>Build skills in a hierarchical order. Why? So that you don’t lose motivation?</p>
<p>What happens when I try to implement 10 ideas at the same time? I fear right from the beginning that I will fail! I have very low hopes of succeeding. And rightly so. The data is very convincing, both from personal experience and from research - you just can’t achieve so many things at the same time (using conventional methods).</p>
<p>It seems like you need to maintain the balance from the time you start till the end. You need to keep your motivation high enough so that you don’t procrastinate too much. You need to make sure other impulses are not very powerful so that you don’t burn out on Will Power.</p>
<p>It seems like that carnival game where there is an electrified wire and a hoop and you have to move the hoop from one end of the wire to another. If you let the hoop touch the wire, a buzzer goes off and you’re out. Really tricky and you can fail at any time. You could get right till the end and still fucking jerk your hand by a millimetre and fail. Just like achieving goals.</p>
<h1 id="the-dilemma">The Dilemma</h1>
<p>I had started the whole Will Power Sequence hoping to resolve this one major dilemma in my head - Go Big and Exciting or go small and safe?</p>
<p>Look at the requirements.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: small at the beginning, big as you grow</p>
<h1 id="how-can-it-fail">How can it fail?</h1>
<p>How can your plan fail?</p>
<p>Some failure modes I have experienced in the past:</p>
<p>You expect too much from yourself everyday. 1000 words everyday is not happening.</p>
<p>Your plan is <strong>too</strong> rigid. It can’t handle the complexities of real life. Requirements keep changing. The situation keeps changing. A static fixed plan is not gonna cut it.</p>
<p>In fact, in light of what we know about To-Do Lists, we should probably not have a plan at all. Every plan is an implicit To-Do List you’re setting up.</p>
<p>You know, we should <em>just… do… things</em>.</p>
<p>Basically, when our plan makes too many assumptions, it’s gonna fail soon cos the chances of all of those assumptions holding even after a long time are practically zero.</p>
<h3 id="bureaucracy">Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>If there is too much peripheral stuff you have to do if you want to get the actual work done, then you will give up sooner or later. You could say that the Bureaucracy reduces motivation and drains Will Power. Example: If you have to keep manually updating a spreadsheet every single fucking day about your progress in writing or whatever, and the spreadsheet has too many fucking fields, all of which you have to fill, you can bet your ass there’s gonna come a day when you fill none. And once you’ve started skipping it, it’s basically just two steps away from oblivion. It then becomes way more likely that you will skip it in the future.</p>
<p>Example: How can we make sure our very own Great 300-Word Experiment doesn’t have too much bureaucracy?</p>
<p>Well, all it asks of you is to publish an essay. It doesn’t expect much other documentation or bullcrap or whatever.</p>
<p>In short: Get out of the way. Have as few obstacles between you and the Actions that will give you direct Impact.</p>
<p>With every action you take, there should be some Impact. Everything else is bullcrap. Ornamentation. Extra baggage. It will drown you when you try to swim across the wide river of motivation.</p>
<h3 id="no-mental-masturbation">No mental masturbation</h3>
<p>If you’re sitting around “designing your plan” or arguing about the theory and trying to create a really good plan, you’re just wasting time.</p>
<p>This is what I’ve discovered over these many years. Don’t trust me. Look at the data around you. At work or in your college, see what actually creates the Impact. How often were lengthy plans and “Design Documents” and “Agendas” created and then left utterly untouched as the people <em>actually</em> doing the work came up with their own Impact-based ideas?</p>
<p>Any time you sit down and write out a plan in detail, you’re screwed.</p>
<p>Any time you sit down and write out a formal document about your plan… God save you!</p>
<p>This may seem extreme.</p>
<h1 id="non-perfectionistic">Non Perfectionistic</h1>
<p>30% success instead of 100%</p>
<h1 id="lose-the-force-luke">Lose the Force, Luke</h1>
<p>Some impulses could lose their force. Are fast food items less tempting to Bodybuilders and sportspersons? I remember that I was not tempted at all by crap food when I went to the gym for a year. I was not gonna spoil my hard-earned muscles for this one minute of crap pleasure.</p>
<p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
<h1 id="later">Later</h1>
<p>Impose priority</p>
<p>Checklist not To-Do List</p>
<h1 id="make-a-dent-in-the-universe">Make a dent in the universe</h1>
<p>All of the above would be worth crap if it didn’t give me better results. We need to keep our ideas grounded in reality.</p>

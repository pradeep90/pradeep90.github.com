<h1 id="the-limiting-factor">The Limiting Factor</h1>
<p>When we think of implementing lots of ideas in our life, we can intuitively feel that there is some sort of limitation, right? We just <em>know</em> that it is gonna go bust sooner or later. How come? What is the limitation?</p>
<p>Is it Will Power? Well, yes, but not always. As we’ve seen, if you’re opposing strong impulses, your finite Will Power will screw you. But, with other actions, it’s mostly just indirect impulses. So, Will Power shouldn’t be <em>that</em> much of a bottleneck. As I’m sitting here writing this essay, I don’t have a strong urge to shut off the laptop and not-write essays. There is no strong directly opposing force. (“SPK! Stop repeating stuff! We got it!”)</p>
<p>This suggests that it is motivation that is the real limiting factor here. I feel like doing something else. Maybe watching some movie. Or surfing the web aimlessly. Or eating. Whatever.</p>
<p>This means that, for fields other than stuff like obesity, addiction, etc., we need to design our “plans” keeping motivation in mind.</p>
<h1 id="what-else-goes-wrong">What else goes wrong?</h1>
<p>What else derails us when we try to implement lots of ideas?</p>
<p>I just tried to imagine what it would be like if I made a list of 15 skills from my website and tried to go about implementing them.</p>
<p>Look, you try too much, you’re gonna fail, ok? It’s a train crash waiting to happen.</p>
<p>And when it does, it is gonna feel really bad. Cos your self-worth and shit will be mixed up with your success and failure. You will feel like you suck.</p>
<p>I just <em>know</em> I’m gonna fail and it just knocks the wind out of my sails. This has <strong>never</strong> worked, as far as I know. Not for me, not for anybody else. Everybody has tons of ideas that they haven’t taken action on.</p>
<p>We need some sort of plan or set of actions that almost <strong>cannot</strong> fail! We need a very high expectancy of success initially.</p>
<p>(Advanced: Even if you do fail, you should fail spectacularly. It should be a Fun Failure. You should get the feeling that you have a lot of power and that because of a miscalculation you didn’t get the result. You should feel that you’re gonna kick its ass the next time! Instead of sitting on your butt crying about what a little bitch you are and how unsuccessful all your attempts have been.)</p>
<h1 id="how-can-it-fail">How can it fail?</h1>
<p>How can your plan fail?</p>
<p>Some failure modes I have experienced in the past:</p>
<p>You expect too much from yourself everyday. 1000 words everyday is not happening.</p>
<h3 id="your-plan-is-too-rigid.">Your plan is <strong>too</strong> rigid.</h3>
<p>It can’t handle the complexities of real life. Requirements keep changing. The situation keeps changing. A static fixed plan is not gonna cut it.</p>
<p>In fact, in light of what we know about To-Do Lists, we should probably not have a plan at all. Every plan is an implicit To-Do List you’re setting up.</p>
<p>You know, we should <em>just… do… things</em>.</p>
<p>Basically, when our plan makes too many assumptions, it’s gonna fail soon cos the chances of all of those assumptions holding even after a long time are practically zero.</p>
<h3 id="bureaucracy">Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>If there is too much peripheral stuff you have to do if you want to get the actual work done, then you will give up sooner or later. You could say that the Bureaucracy reduces motivation and drains Will Power. Example: If you have to keep manually updating a spreadsheet every single fucking day about your progress in writing or whatever, and the spreadsheet has too many fucking fields, all of which you have to fill, you can bet your ass there’s gonna come a day when you fill none. And once you’ve started skipping it, it’s basically just two steps away from oblivion. It then becomes way more likely that you will skip it in the future.</p>
<p>Example: How can we make sure our very own Great 300-Word Experiment doesn’t have too much bureaucracy?</p>
<p>Well, all it asks of you is to publish an essay. It doesn’t expect much other documentation or bullcrap or whatever.</p>
<p>In short: Get out of the way. Have as few obstacles between you and the Actions that will give you direct Impact.</p>
<p>With every action you take, there should be some Impact. Everything else is bullcrap. Ornamentation. Extra baggage. It will drown you when you try to swim across the wide river of motivation.</p>
<h3 id="no-mental-masturbation">No mental masturbation</h3>
<p>If you’re sitting around “designing your plan” or arguing about the theory and trying to create a really good plan, you’re just wasting time.</p>
<p>This is what I’ve discovered over these many years. Don’t trust me. Look at the data around you. At work or in your college, see what actually creates the Impact. How often were lengthy plans and “Design Documents” and “Agendas” created and then left utterly untouched as the people <em>actually</em> doing the work came up with their own Impact-based ideas?</p>
<p>Any time you sit down and write out a plan in detail, you’re screwed.</p>
<p>Any time you sit down and write out a formal document about your plan… God save you!</p>
<p>This may seem extreme.</p>
<h3 id="too-many-parts">Too many parts</h3>
<p>The Rule of Three</p>
<p>If you require more than three things to work together, you’re going to fail.</p>
<p>There can be more than one plot, and more than one plotter.</p>
<h3 id="expecting-too-great-success">Expecting too great success</h3>
<p>Most ideas suck more than you know. I think we routinely overestimate how much Impact some idea will have.</p>
<p>This seems to suggest that we shouldn’t aim for the moon. More often than not, we’ll fall short and that will damp our motivation next time. Your mind will remember the last times you had aimed big and how you’d fallen on your face, and will now try to avoid such endeavours.</p>
<h3 id="perfectionistic">Perfectionistic</h3>
<p>30% success instead of 100%</p>
<h1 id="talk-in-terms-of-impact">Talk in terms of Impact</h1>
<p>What would it mean to “implement all those ideas”? Be concrete.</p>
<p>Look at the problem in more detail.</p>
<p>What usually goes wrong? Be concrete. Take real examples.</p>
<p>What goes right? Be concrete. Take real examples.</p>
<p>In fact, formally create the Ideal Plan. (then, see how it goes and take it from there)</p>
<h1 id="solutions">Solutions</h1>
<p>One Big Shot + Long time small shot vs Long time Big shot</p>
<p>Have a huge Battle, then rest, train, huge Battle… just like Goku!</p>
<p>For what kinds of tasks will this model work?</p>
<p>Not for bodybuilding, right? You have to go to the gym many times a week and do cardio lots of times on top of that. Maybe you have a specific bulking and ripping period before a show or whatever.</p>
<h3 id="static-plan-short-term-dynamic-no-plan-long-run">Static Plan short term + Dynamic no-Plan long run</h3>
<p>Planning is a necessary evil. It is a response to Risk. The effectiveness of a plan depends both on</p>
<h4 id="how-risky-it-is">how risky it is</h4>
<p>You would need powerful tools to reduce the risk.</p>
<p>What do powerful tools do? They make it easy to handle changes.</p>
<p>They reduce the risk of <strong>getting it wrong</strong>! They reduce the risk of making wrong predictions about the future and about what you REALLY want!</p>
<p>You can try out lots of different things, get new insights, try them out and get to the really effective solutions.</p>
<p>The question is: what sort of turnaround time do you need? How much time will it take to “try out an idea” and decide whether it is right or whether you should “try out” something else?</p>
<p>So, if you’re gonna try something no matter what for a week, then you can use a static plan for that week.</p>
<p>And then, how likely are you to be wrong?</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re gonna try to implement a new idea. You plan to take a month for it. What happens?</p>
<p>Assumptions: It is the most important plan you can think of right now. You’re not gonna change in between because something else was more important. This is the most important thing (else, why are you doing this now?). And if something else is more important, it would either justify jettisoning this plan or it won’t.</p>
<p>So, you go ahead. What could possibly happen (in a short-term static plan)?</p>
<p>You could not have time for this cos something unavoidable came in between - like work or illness.</p>
<p>Your motivation for doing this could be much less than your Impulse for doing other stuff. Like what? Watching movies, going out (lol), sleeping, reading books, etc.</p>
<p>How could that happen?</p>
<p>You may not feel the Value of the task you’re doing. We can counter this by designing it as Satisfying Work.</p>
<p>You may have Low Expectancy of success. Maybe the task is not designed to match your skill level. It expects too much out of you. Look at my performance at regular scheduled intervals and rework the plan. Also, Fun Failure.</p>
<p>Maybe you can’t see the results in front of your eyes right away. Satisfying Work. Immediate Feedback.</p>
<p>Maybe other things become way more interesting. Examples: Romantic movie that just occupies your mind in all the day-dreaming. But other important things could seem more interesting too, right? Like Haskell! I picked it up on the side. Lots of things are picked up on the side without any deliberate planning.</p>
<p>Your skill level could change and the current plan could become obsolete. You need to go to the next level.</p>
<p>You discover that this plan doesn’t really work for getting you the results you want. Example: My RSI plan???</p>
<p>What is most likely to happen is that you feel that you’re NOT DOING ENOUGH! You will then throw this plan away and draft a new plan!</p>
<p>Also, it is also pretty likely (if you implement many ideas) that there is just too much work to do, you’ll have very low expectancy and high delay (cos the immediateness of results will be inversely proportional to the number of things you’re doing at the same time). Plus, higher impulsiveness cos of Will Power drainage ???</p>
<hr />
<p>So, which of these short-term failure modes is most likely?</p>
<p>Work or illness??? Hmmm… illness is pretty rare. But, work could throw a spanner in the works. What if you have some sort of team dinner or crap stuff and you have to stay late for some deadline? Okay. This just means that we can’t be TOO rigid. There will be a couple of days in a month where you have no control. Cool.</p>
<p>Let’s assume that we can control the Motivation part. Let’s assume that we can take care of Value, Expectancy, Delay, etc. by using Gamification techniques.</p>
<p>Other unrelated things become more interesting? ??? Assume we can avoid this. Revise this assumption later.</p>
<p>Your skill level could change like hell and make the plan obsolete. This is iffy! It is difficult to predict exactly how our skill level will grow. Try not to assume too much about how you think it will grow. Leave it open-ended.</p>
<p>It should favour growth! It should not place arbitrary restrictions on me. It should not resist expansion.</p>
<p>“This plan doesn’t work!” - Quickly change it. Full refund. No questions asked. No embarrassment or ridicule. Look at what went wrong and fix it.</p>
<p>You feel you’re not doing enough! You’re not doing enough here (this is covered in the “this plan isn’t working” section)! You’re not doing enough in other areas! Example: You get reminded that your eyesight sucks! You have a belly! You’ve lost muscles. You haven’t run your Drills in a long time. And all the other crap that keeps piling up.</p>
<p>Hmmm… that suggests that a plan can’t go on forever. You can’t keep ignoring these things. But, at the same time, you can’t splinter your attention into so many shards and still get great results everywhere. Not happening. This means that we should probably have periods of High Intensity Training where you beat the shit out of your main problem. And then, just as importantly, you have a Low Intensity Off-Season period where you get the rest of your life back in order and do the hundred little things that need to work for a functioning life.</p>
<p>Cool. So, how do you implement multiple ideas at the same time? Or do you just go one idea at a time? Do you plan to “master” it, make it automatic, and then move on to something else?</p>
<p>I guess this comes down to the One-Shot vs Repeated-Application classification.</p>
<hr />
<h5 id="what-about-experimentation-if-we-are-very-likely-to-be-wrong-shouldnt-you-stress-on-trial-and-error">What about experimentation? If we are very likely to be wrong, shouldn’t you stress on trial and error?</h5>
<p>Could we use rapid prototyping? Get a Version 1.0 out as fast as possible?</p>
<p>Basically, get the intended Impact (for the current short-term plan) using any means possible, no matter how ugly.</p>
<p>Then, keeping the engine running, try something else and get the same Impact.</p>
<p>Then, again, keeping the engine running, try to improve something else and get the same Impact or better.</p>
<p>MAJOR Requirement: We must not flinch one bit from making mistakes!!!</p>
<p>Case in point: Publishing an experimental essay is scary. I don’t want to do it. Why (from a Motivation pov)? I get results without delay. I have very low Expectancy of Success. And Negative Value. People will laugh and stuff.</p>
<p>Fuck!!! It should be a highly playful interactive environment! No holds barred. You go in there and you “just… do… things”!</p>
<p>I’m thinking of REPLs. I’m thinking of Lisp. I’m thinking of Emacs!!!</p>
<p>Fuck! That’s what Games are!!! Motherfucker!</p>
<p>Fear of Failure is the Root of all Evil (during training)! Do EVERYTHING in your power to root out every last factor that makes you sweat when you contemplate a failure.</p>
<h5 id="what-could-powerful-tools-do-for-us-here-what-might-they-look-like">What could powerful tools do for us here? What might they look like?</h5>
<p>Highly interactive forgiving environments!!!</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="and-how-much-you-can-predict-the-future">And how much you can predict the future</h4>
<p>If you can accurately determine how much free time you’ll have over the next week, you can make proper plans to use the time.</p>
<p>If it is unpredictable and you schedule a lot of work, you won’t be able to get it done and you will feel miserable.</p>
<h3 id="it-usually-all-comes-together-or-it-fails-spectacularly.-any-way-to-use-this">It usually all comes together or it fails spectacularly. Any way to use this?</h3>
<h1 id="prepare-yourself-goku-its-time">Prepare yourself, Goku… It’s Time!</h1>
<p>Maybe that’s one reason why it feels <em>hopeless</em> to implement many new ideas (or even just one) - it takes a long time for good results to come.</p>
<p>And, in our mind, a long time = never. So, your mind behaves the way it would when you try to do something impossible, it just gives you zero motivation for it.</p>
<p>It’s gonna take us longer than we <em>want</em> but earlier than we <em>expect</em>. We just need to hang in during the gap between those two times.</p>
<h1 id="automaticity">Automaticity</h1>
<p>Do it so often and reward it so much that it becomes a habit. It becomes independent of motivation.</p>
<p>Composable solutions - do them in the right order and you won’t have to worry about the earlier ones because they would be taken care of… maybe refresh them once in a while, like Spaced Repetition</p>
<h1 id="unplanned-joys">Unplanned Joys</h1>
<p>Remember this, pretty much EVERYTHING you have learned and mastered in life has come about pretty much by accident. In other words, you didn’t make elaborate plans for it. Neither did anybody else. You went “with the flow”, did some short-term decision-making, and ended up getting pretty good results.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that’s optimal. I’m just saying that’s what happens. If we go with the flow most of the time, we are bound to end up with some crappy decisions. Our thinking processes (conscious or subconscious) are not perfect. Sure, they may seem like bad decisions when you compare with the people around you, but that’s because they too are making crappy decisions. Remember, We Are All Dumbasses.</p>
<p>But it is a fact that most of the stuff you’ve accomplished, the skills you’ve mastered, and the knowledge you’ve gained have all happened without insane amounts of planning. That right there is the feasibility proof that we can achieve quite a great amount of stuff without any Special Deliberate Anti-Akrasia Techniques.</p>
<p>Hmmm… we should probably try to extract the actual implicit techniques we used and master them separately. Look at what works and magnify it, instead of thinking up something that <em>sounds</em> right to you but sucks in real life.</p>
<h1 id="less-hard">Less Hard</h1>
<p>Skill and motivation. Becomes less hard.</p>
<p>Skilled people have more fun.</p>
<p>Steve Yegge quote about skiers.</p>
<p>Flow. Not while you practice, but when you use your skill.</p>
<h1 id="motivation-equation">Motivation Equation</h1>
<h1 id="versions">Versions</h1>
<p>Have a basic version 1.0</p>
<h1 id="that-is-an-order">That is an Order!</h1>
<p>Build skills in a hierarchical order. Why? So that you don’t lose motivation?</p>
<p>What happens when I try to implement 10 ideas at the same time? I fear right from the beginning that I will fail! I have very low hopes of succeeding. And rightly so. The data is very convincing, both from personal experience and from research - you just can’t achieve so many things at the same time (using conventional methods).</p>
<p>It seems like you need to maintain the balance from the time you start till the end. You need to keep your motivation high enough so that you don’t procrastinate too much. You need to make sure other impulses are not very powerful so that you don’t burn out on Will Power.</p>
<p>It seems like that carnival game where there is an electrified wire and a hoop and you have to move the hoop from one end of the wire to another. If you let the hoop touch the wire, a buzzer goes off and you’re out. Really tricky and you can fail at any time. You could get right till the end and still fucking jerk your hand by a millimetre and fail. Just like achieving goals.</p>
<h1 id="the-dilemma">The Dilemma</h1>
<p>I had started the whole Will Power Sequence hoping to resolve this one major dilemma in my head - Go Big and Exciting or go small and safe?</p>
<p>Look at the requirements.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: small at the beginning, big as you grow</p>
<h1 id="lose-the-force-luke">Lose the Force, Luke</h1>
<p>Some impulses could lose their force. Are fast food items less tempting to Bodybuilders and sportspersons? I remember that I was not tempted at all by crap food when I went to the gym for a year. I was not gonna spoil my hard-earned muscles for this one minute of crap pleasure.</p>
<p>How can you find out if fast food really has become less tempting? See how much Will Power the Bodybuilder loses when he refuses the food. If it doesn’t go down much, then he probably wasn’t tempted at all. Maybe do it several times to get a potentially significant drop in Will Power.</p>
<p>I’m guessing this has to do with how excited your mind gets about the thing. If you no longer have a strong desire for that thing, then there is no longer an “impulse” and so, you won’t have to exert much Will Power.</p>
<p>Example: Old men probably don’t have as much desire for attracting young hot women as they did when they were young. Ditto for fast food. Your grandparents probably don’t eat any fast food or even sweets and snacks or anything.</p>

<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What would a supportive environment for idea-generation look like?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="the-main-point">The Main Point</h1>
<p>What have I been driving at above?</p>
<p>What was really the problem in the first place? The High Perceived Cost of Failure!</p>
<p>It felt like failure would be totally bad and so I avoided experimenting too much.</p>
<h1 id="writing-for-others---v2.0">Writing for Others - v2.0</h1>
<p>In other words, whenever I hesitate to write because I’m afraid my understanding isn’t good enough, I should remember the above lessons -</p>
<p>Let’s assume I’m not writing essays for the sake of writing essays. If I’ve written something, it means that it was useful to me in some way - it clarified some idea, generated some new ones, made new connections, etc. The end product may suck, of course. The final essay may not even have any good ideas, but it may help by simply showing that this particular idea is a dead-end. No need to go down that road anymore. It saves me time in the future.</p>
<p>So, if I <strong>try</strong> something in an essay, it will help me out, whether or not the final product contains actionable ideas. In other words, unless I write to teach others (God forbid!), I will definitely grow stronger in some way.</p>
<p>Then, what is the problem? If I write, I gain. There can be no possible argument against that! Why don’t I write?</p>
<p>I don’t write because it feels to me that the cost of writing a crap idea-less essay is very high! Why? Cos every single other essay I wrote has at least one usable original idea in it (except the written-for-others ones). It feels like I will dilute the “quality” of my website by writing an empty experimental essay.</p>
<p>My Yo-voice has been raring to go at me for the last few minutes. Might as well let it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yo! What the fuck do you mean “usable original idea”?!! I just told you in the flashback that these aren’t ideas, these are just shoelaces, these are useless to everyone and to you. Which part didn’t you understand? “Full” or “of” or “shit”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the cost of failure is very high! And what does that do? It inhibits innovation as effectively as spraying toxic chemicals over a growing plant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not every change is an improvement, but every improvement is a change!</p>

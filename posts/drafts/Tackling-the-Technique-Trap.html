<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: How do we avoid the problems with techniques and actually get results?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="a-saner-way">A Saner Way</h1>
<p>Let’s address each problem in the Technique Trap.</p>
<p>We must accept <em>only</em> those techniques that are backed by empirical evidence. Not what sounds cool. Not what sounds reasonable. Not what seems like it will <em>definitely</em> work. Empirical evidence.</p>
<p>Where might we find such technique, you ask? Welcome to the world of scientific journals. In those valuable tomes, people put various techniques to the test, noting down how much benefit they really gave. We need to give techniques credit only for the results they have got, nothing more.</p>
<p>More importantly, what sort of techniques should we not pay heed to? Most of the non-fiction around you, blog posts, videos, TED talks - except if they quote empirical studies. No Evidence, No Right to Talk. The key is to <em>not</em> go by your gut feeling about the value of a technique. Just Say No to Empty Techniques.</p>
<p>Now that you do have the <em>name</em> of an evidence-based technique (not the technique itself), go ahead and get the instructions for the technique. It’s not a technique unless you have an actionable, step-by-step procedure that <em>you</em> can apply in real life. If not, then you’re just fooling yourself by getting excited about the name (“Scientific Method”, “Positive Psychology”).</p>
<p>For example, I thought I understood how the Scientific Method worked, but when I sat down to “use it in my life somewhere” I came up blank. I didn’t know where to begin. It all seemed simple in the textbook toy scenarios. In the real world, I didn’t even know how to come up with hypotheses - there seemed to be so many possibilities. What to do? Where to begin? How to discover differing predictions? There’s a lot hidden behind the simple instruction “Step one: Formulate your hypotheses”.</p>
<p>Also, <em>you</em>, personally, need to have it with you. Not in some book somewhere, not online. With you, right now.</p>
<p>Next, don’t allow yourself to think you have the technique unless you have validated your understanding at each step. Make sure that your interpretation of a step in the technique is backed up by feedback from a coach or a friend or an objective evaluation of some sort. Essays help, but they’re not enough. “This seems right” is not good enough. It’s not until you’ve gained a lot of expertise that you can trust your own feel. Seek out feedback like you’re possessed. Ask to be corrected at every step - while working out in the gym, or writing an essay, or making a speech. It’s not an insult, it’s information. It’s a finger in the face of Naive Realism. Love feedback. Seek it.</p>
<p>Get a Measurement tool. If it doesn’t have hardcore tests or measurements, it’s not a real technique. There should be a real chance of you failing - being too heavy, too slow, too forgetful, too weak, etc. Our aim is to show ourselves exactly how much we suck. Without measurements, everything else is in vain.</p>
<p>Set up scenarios with different configurations and test out your grasp of the technique. If you’ve understood the technique, you should be able to use it to get decent performance in several configurations as per the Measurement tool. Remember, the technique is in your head, and we can only know how much of it is there by seeing what situations it can handle.</p>
<p>With all that done, go ahead and <em>actually</em> apply the verified technique you now have. Use a chart or journal or any other tool to keep track of how much you’re really using the technique. Apply it a lot. Do it and you shall receive.</p>
<h1 id="further-nuances">Further nuances</h1>
<p>If you’ve actually exhausted all the empirical techniques in your domain (go check again), then you can start looking at some of the more untested ones to see if they work. Be wary, though. If it really is as great a technique as the seller (blogger, author, TED talker) claims, then why hasn’t it been tested in empirical studies? What, we’re just supposed to take their word for it?</p>
<p>After a while in your field, you may develop a few new “techniques” of your own. Beware! This is the easiest Technique Trap to fall into. Because your own preciousss techniques will seem convincing and obviously valuable, you will be less likely to subject them to rigorous empirical tests. “It works, I know it for sure” has been the path to doom for many an inventor. At the very least, apply all the tests listed here for your “technique”, again and again and again. Make sure you vet your “technique” with several other people and ask <em>them</em> to judge your “technique” using the above standards. Be careful not to use your “technique” to feel superior to others. It’s not proven to work yet. Oh, and, did I mention, what you have is a “technique”, until proven otherwise.</p>
<p>Potential does not count. It doesn’t matter how <em>awesome</em> you think the technique is, if you can’t make it give you great results on a test, it is worthless. Always ask the Fundamental Meta-Question of Rationality: If your Rationality technique is so good, why haven’t you got Insane Impact yet?</p>
<p>It’s not all bad news. The same yardstick applies to everyone else too. If they haven’t passed tests, they don’t have those techniques either. It truly is a level playing field.</p>
<p>As a corollary, do not surrender prematurely. Even if a domain seems completely “out of your league”, even if every single person in that field seems a 100x better than you in every single way, and you just want to crawl into a hole and never show your face again… you still have to give it a try. At least once. Preferably, several times, just to make sure. How can you know unless you get empirical evidence?</p>
<p>On the flip side, no unwarranted superiority allowed. Your power level equals what you’ve achieved so far. Keep your test scores handy and allow yourself only as much pride as the tests dictate. Say, if you work out, judge yourself only by the size of your muscles, or your lifting strength, or your body fat level; not by the awesomeness of the exercise program you’re following. No browbeating with the epic techniques you “know”. You are a newbie unless you’ve got test results that say otherwise.</p>
<h1 id="the-litany-against-techniques">The Litany Against “Techniques”</h1>
<p>Expect it to take quite a bit of practice and testing to get the results you want. If it is a worthwhile technique, then it probably involves dealing with a lot of complex scenarios. Building up your neural circuits to tackle so many scenarios will take time. Don’t give up too soon.</p>
<p>However, there is hope. If people don’t really have the techniques they think they do, then their current performance doesn’t reflect the true potential of the techniques. There are probably a lot of low-hanging fruits. We must revise our assumptions of how much we are capable of. We must indeed have a sense that more is possible<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>. But, we must stop thinking that techniques will be very easy to master. That is wrong. Techniques will give you more results than you expected, but take more effort than you hoped.</p>
<p>In short, techniques are overrated. Do <em>not</em> get too impressed with yourself if you have read up a few exciting-looking ideas online. If you think your life is gonna end up becoming way better now that you have this shiny new technique, it’s a red flag (this happens to me every time). Say No to Technique Porn. Those brilliant ideas and hacks and tips and how-tos and lifestyle changes and productivity tools that you read up online - almost certainly nonsense, all of it. They just make you feel good, but add no real value to your life. They distract you from the impactful action you really could be taking.</p>
<p>The Litany Against “Techniques” might be helpful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I have collected are “techniques”. They are not real techniques. Real techniques give you results. What I have collected simply give me the feeling of superiority.</p>
<p>Deliver me from productivity tips.</p>
<p>Deliver me from clever blogs.</p>
<p>Deliver me from unscientific techniques pushed by <del>snake oil salesmen</del> self-help authors.</p>
<p>Deliver me from my own naivete.</p>
<p>Grant me the serenity to apply the techniques that work, the forbearance to avoid the techniques that don’t, and the <del>wisdom</del> empirical evidence to know the difference. # Excerpt from The Technique Trap</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="selling-superiority">Selling Superiority</h2>
<p>So we don’t use techniques for their benefits, but rather for their Epic Awesome <em>potential</em> benefits, which is just a proxy for the superiority we feel.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: People aren’t selling techniques. They’re selling superiority.</p>
<p>All those bloggers, lifehackers, lifestyle-designers, how-to magazine writers, and non-fiction authors - they’re selling you means for feeling superior to others. They probably don’t <em>actually</em> use those “techniques” and neither will you.</p>
<p>It’s not “this technique will increase your productivity by X units”, but rather “this technique will increase your <em>superiority</em> by X units.”</p>
<p>Those bloggers or authors are hardly going to put their pet techniques through harsh empirical tests. With all the effort and public commitment they’re putting into their techniques, the authors are easy prey for Affective Death Spirals. Insisting on empirical evidence at each step takes a tremendous amount of determination, especially when seductive alternatives lie in wait. So, they will likely fall straight into the Trap of half-assed “Epic Awesome Techniques”.</p>
<p>So, we sit around reading, writing, and exchanging nothing but means for superiority. The original aim of performance-increase is lost somewhere by the wayside. It’s shiny, empty labels all the way.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="sharing-for-superiority---you-should-check-this-out">Sharing for Superiority - “You should check this out!”</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Check out this movie. It’s awesome.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“You haven’t watched that TV show?! Hey, you’ve missed out on a lot. You <em>have</em> to watch it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Hidden implication</strong>: If you haven’t watched that TV show (or read that book or learnt about that “technique”), your life is significantly worse than mine. And, therefore, if I have watched the show, my life is significantly better than yours.</p>
<p>We feel that in our bones, when we say or hear those words, even though there is almost <strong>zero</strong> empirical increase in your quality of life because of the show (or book or “technique”).</p>
<p>It’s just to make yourself feel superior.</p>
<p>This is another disquieting corollary of the Net Benefits Hypothesis. You will want to shine light on people’s ignorance of techniques to make yourself feel better.<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>People always have too much on their plate. They’re almost guaranteed to <em>not</em> take up your call for action. So, by “sharing” your technique, you get to feel superior because now they know that you “know” this and thus you get to be in their face. It makes the difference between you feel more real. Every time you need a bit of a boost, you can just remind them about that technique and they’ll say they haven’t got around to it. You get to feel sorry for them and feel awesome about yourself.</p>
<p>Plus, you get to pontificate about how other people are not at all open-minded (unlike you).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning Sign: “You should check this out”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Implicit Meaning: “I did. If you don’t, that means I have one over you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As usual, you don’t even have to master the technique or apply it a lot or even have a real technique at all. All you have to do is believe you have a technique and make <em>them</em> believe you have a technique and you’re done. Feeling of superiority guaranteed.</p>
<p>Ever wanted to punch a guy who’s pushing a movie on you and saying that you “<em>have</em> to watch this”? Or a guy who’s pushing some new app he found and saying that you “<em>have</em> to check this out”? This was probably why. He was using his “knowledge” of the “technique” to feel superior and make you feel inferior.</p>
<p>This last one suggests that people who care a lot about “self-improvement” (hint hint) and who get <em>very excited</em> about “techniques” are people who’re using those “techniques” to feel superior to others. I think I’ve been guilty of this for a long time now.</p>
<h2 id="the-technique-trap-for-smart-kids">The Technique Trap for Smart Kids</h2>
<p>A subtler version of the Technique Trap is when you <em>do</em> get empirical evidence for some of your claims.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hey, I saw it in a peer-reviewed journal. F*ck you. I win.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the above gentleman has managed to avoid the trap of accepting untested techniques. But, the rabbit hole goes much deeper. Specifically, it doesn’t matter if <em>someone else</em> has got empirical results using the technique. Do <em>you</em> actually possess the technique? Have <em>you</em> correctly interpreted the instructions from the aforementioned peer-reviewed journal? Most importantly, have <em>you</em> actually built up the neural circuits in your brain by taking action in different complex scenarios and getting feedback from some empirical tool? Without that, all you have is the mere ghost of a technique parading as the real, live thing.</p>
<p>I think this is the most common mistake among the smarter self-improvement folk. They push aside the popular self-help books and go straight for the scientific journals. So far so good. But then, they fall prey to the mistake of thinking that just because they have the instructions, they have the technique itself. They may not feel the need to actually build up the technique or measure their progress, especially in areas where empirical measures aren’t common - which is sadly, much of “Rationality”.</p>
<h2 id="the-envy-backlash">The Envy Backlash</h2>
<p>The Technique Trap isn’t all about making yourself feel better, though. Most of the <em>envy</em> you felt towards others was because of the “techniques” you thought they knew.</p>
<p>You looked at them and saw them possessing many great “techniques” that you didn’t. You added up the potential benefits as best as you could (with a boatload of biases amping up the benefits), and you found out that they were far, far better than you. So, you curled up into a ball and decided to give up forever in that particular field. That’s what envy usually does.</p>
<p>Here’s the first bit of heartening news so far: Those were all probably inflated and imaginary benefits. If we have learnt anything from Naive Realism, it’s that the <em>only</em> thing we should use for judgment is empirical evidence.</p>
<p>How good really is their empirical performance? No, not how impressive they look, not how intimidating their resume seems, and certainly not how much other people seem to think they’re the bomb. Look past your heat-of-the-moment subjective impressions. Disregard their image - they’ve optimized it to look as impressive as possible. What is their <em>actual</em> performance like?</p>
<p>Know this now: you mistook claims of familiarity for actual mastery. Knowing the names of lots of techniques and being able to rattle off their instructions from memory is not the same as having the circuits to deliver the right response to complex scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: You don’t need to be scared of anyone who claims to “know” certain techniques. Nor even if they claim to have “mastered” them.</p>

<li><p>If you’ve noticed, the above essay counts as a technique.</p>
<p>Or, rather, as the <em>instructions</em> for a technique.</p>
<p>What does that mean? It means I need to go collect empirical evidence that it actually does work. Will do that.</p></li>

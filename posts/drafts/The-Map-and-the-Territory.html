<p><strong>Entry Question</strong>: What does it to make your Map closely reflect the Territory?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="map-vs-territory">Map vs Territory</h1>
<p>Territory = Set of Events</p>
<p>Map = Predictions for those Events</p>
<h1 id="prediction-constrained-anticipation">Prediction = Constrained Anticipation</h1>
<p>This follows from the 100-point bet analogy. You have 100% of probability. Spread it out among the outcomes. You cannot have more than 100% of probability in your predictions. That’s what it means to have Constrained Anticipation.</p>
<p>You cannot say Dhoni will hit a six with 90% probability and then say he will hit a four with 90% probability. If you assign 90% probability to hitting a six, you only have 10% probability left for all the other outcomes. Deal with it.</p>
<p>What do you anticipate? What do you expect to see? You cannot expect to see a six and, at the same time, expect to see a four. Your expectations are constrained. You cannot expect to see every possible outcome. Expecting to see one outcome reduces your expectations for another.</p>
<p>Assigning high probability to one outcome necessarily leaves less probability for the others. In other words, you cannot have your cake and eat it too.</p>
<p>What this means is, you cannot say “I told you so” no matter what happens.</p>
<p>You have to leave yourself open to surprise. If some low probability outcome happens, you have to suck it up. You cannot say “Oh… I predicted that too”. No, you didn’t.</p>
<p>This is how you can make “predictions” about stuff in the past too. You just say how your anticipation about those events is constrained.</p>
<h1 id="reflecting-the-territory">Reflecting the Territory</h1>
<p>Incorporating our understanding of Prediction:</p>
<p>Map = Anticipation-Constraints about the Events in the Territory</p>
<p>Note: Your Map could be wrong. You could have the wrong anticipations.</p>
<p>Map reflects Territory = You have a High Prediction Score</p>
<p>You have high Predictive Power for the events in the Territory</p>
<p>Map is basically your final predictions about the Territory You get it by combining the predictions of all your hypotheses, weighted by their posterior probabilities</p>
<p>So, the Complexities of your Hypotheses have already been incorporated into their posterior probabilities. No need to consider it here.</p>
<p>If you have a simple hypothesis that predicts stuff correctly and sharply (say, a causal structure), then it will rule. It will end up having a very high posterior probability and thus dominate your final prediction.</p>
<h1 id="what-makes-a-good-map">What makes a good Map</h1>
<p>Yeah, you would want to have high Prediction Score.</p>
<p>But, informally speaking, how would you know if your current Map is a good one or not?</p>
<p>Does it actually constrain your anticipations for those events? Do your beliefs pay rent?</p>
<p>Do you even KNOW what those events are? What the f*ck are you making predictions about?</p>
<p>Do you just “think” you make predictions and make them correctly about the “territory”?</p>
<p>You’re only allowed to say you truly know a subject - aka have a Map that truly reflects the Territory - when you can make accurate predictions about all events that are part of that subject. You have mastered a subject when you have a high Prediction Score there.</p>
<p>For example, getting the right answer on nearly all the questions on your Math exams. Being able to deal with nearly any situation that comes up in your job.</p>

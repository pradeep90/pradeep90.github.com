            <h1>Implementing Ideas</h1>

            <center><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/t31.0-8/p600x600/10257116_10202295769100492_2438594605053717342_o.jpg" height="400" width="300" class="sujeet-pic" alt="Sujeet pic" /></center>

<h1 id="details">Details</h1>
<p>Unincorporated ideas are worthless. Ideas that just remain so without being translated into action. How do we incorporate most (if not all) of our awesome ideas into our lives?</p>
<p>Let’s look at the problem in more detail (long time since I’ve said that, right?).</p>
<p>Say, we have 15 ideas for improving our life. Needless to say, we haven’t incorporated any of them. How do we best go about it?</p>
<p>The Will Power Depletion problem means that we can’t incorporate too many ideas at the same time. We will crash and burn. So, we want to take up only a few ideas at a time.</p>
<p>Similarly, the To-Do List problem teaches us that we shouldn’t keep around a list of ideas we haven’t incorporated. It should truly be out of our sight and out of our mind. Thankfully, this shit happens naturally.</p>
<p>Is that it?</p>
<p>The biggest problem that remains is that it takes a huge investment of time, energy, and Will Power resources to go from Idea to Impact. The more ideas we want to implement, the more and more time and energy we will need, right? But our resources are finite.</p>
<p>How do we overcome this problem?</p>
<h1 id="multiplication-tables">Multiplication tables</h1>
<p>Why isn’t it a problem for you to remember the basic multiplication tables? 7 times 3 is 21. As easy as it gets.</p>
<p>Why isn’t it a problem for you to brush your teeth pretty much everyday when you wake up?</p>
<p>Why is it such a bitch to not eat that bit of pastry? Or pass up on pizza?</p>
<p>Why is it no problem for me to write lots and lots of code now whereas I used to give up on 2000 lines of C++ code earlier? What happened?</p>
<p>Why is it no trouble at all for me to write around 1500 words everyday? I used to struggle to write even a 1000 words on my best days when I was younger. I remember, cos my eight grade maximum was 1660 words. I had never written that much! I was so proud of that! Now, that’s like the bare minimum for a decent day’s work.</p>
<p>What changed?</p>
<p>What’s the difference between sleeping on time vs writing an essay (for me)? What is the difference between not eating crap vs writing code in Lisp (for me)? What is the difference between implementing lots of ideas from my past vs cooking everyday (for me)?</p>
<p>And it’s not like one of them is about making an impact whereas the other is just about mental masturbation. Both are pretty impactful. I have written essays. I have written code. I have cooked lots of meals.</p>
<p>Why the motherfucking discrimination?</p>
<h1 id="classification">Classification</h1>
<p>What depletes Will Power?</p>
<p>My best understanding, as I mentioned last time, is that your Will Power gets depleted when you act <em>against your impulses</em>.</p>
<p>That suggests one way of classifying ideas. Those that have some Strong Impulse against them and those that don’t.</p>
<p>For example, obesity is a big problem because it is hard to eat healthy and workout regularly and stuff. Why is it hard? Because there is a very strong urge in your mind making you want to eat high-sugar, oily, processed food and seems to resist working out. You can literally feel this by going into any bakery or chocolate shop and just staring at the delicacies there. Smell them. And then try not to buy anything. Yup. You will either succumb to the urge or you will pay a heavy Will Power price and have less for later.</p>
<hr />
<p>How can we measure how strong our impulse against something is?</p>
<p>By doing the thing and seeing how much our Will Power goes down. The more it goes down, the more we had to resist the impulse. Thus, we can measure the strength of the impulse.</p>
<hr />
<p>What about writing code (for me)? Is there a strong impulse against it? Nah. When I sit down to write code, there isn’t anything pulling me in the opposite direction. In fact, I like coding. You could even say that there is an impulse to do more coding. I get high on programming. I love reading about programming and watching talks about programming. It doesn’t feel like a chore.</p>
<p>Ditto for writing essays. Ditto for cooking. I <em>feel</em> like I get value out of these things. I get value out of healthy eating too, but I don’t <em>feel</em> it.</p>
<p>In other words, ideas are of two kinds - those that have a strong natural impulse directly against them and those that don’t.</p>
<p>When you try to eat healthy food, there is a strong force making you want to eat the exact opposite - eat unhealthy food.</p>
<p>When you try to <em>not</em> to keep surfing web pages aimlessly, there is a strong force making you want to do the exact opposite - surf more web pages.</p>
<p>What about when you sit down and try to write essays? Your body doesn’t love not-writing essays (the way it loves oily food). Your body doesn’t hate writing essays (like it hates not-surfing web pages). What’s its problem, then? Why do you and I fail so often in writing essays despite our best intentions?</p>
<p>Sure, there’s no impulse aimed directly at the activity of writing or not writing essays. But, there are impulses aimed elsewhere. You could be surfing web pages and checking out awesome new blog posts and epic videos! Instead of sitting here doing boring crap! You could be eating some awesome, tasty food! Writing essays is getting in the way of those other things. Hence, it must go! Off with its head!</p>
<h1 id="stuff">Stuff</h1>
<p>Strong impulse vs not very strong impulse against your goal</p>
<p>(I think that will be the same as Automatable vs non-automatable. The impulse is real.)</p>
<p>Skill vs not a skill???</p>
<p>If it is a skill, you can Deep Practice it and build your circuit. Basically, if you were failing because it was HARD to do it, you will fail less cos it will become easier and easier.</p>
<p>Is that the same as Hard to do vs not very hard to do??? Not about impulses, but just about the required skill vs your current skill.</p>
<h1 id="automaticity">Automaticity</h1>
<p>Build skills in a hierarchical order</p>
<p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
<h1 id="later">Later</h1>
<p>What to do?</p>
<p>Keep it Real actions?</p>
<p>We need to deal in terms of actions and impact instead of ideas.</p>
<p>It seems that you have to solve the general To-Do List problem before you can solve this one, because this boils down to the To-Do List problem.</p>
<p>Composable solutions - do them in the right order and you won’t have to worry about the earlier ones because they would be taken care of… maybe refresh them once in a while, like Spaced Repetition</p>
<p>Impose priority</p>
<p>Checklist not To-Do List</p>

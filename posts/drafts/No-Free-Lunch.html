<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What is the price of a free book?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="books">Books</h1>
<p>The same problem occurs with books.</p>
<p>When you have a folder full of 100 classic books, which of them is the best?</p>
<p>You can’t really tell. You would have to read all of them and you wouldn’t be able to make a good judgement because you would have read some of them before the others and so on.</p>
<p>What could an alternative be?</p>
<p>First, we know that humans adapt to stuff. Your mind won’t always find something insanely attractive and interesting. Things become boring. That is the way of life as a human. Nothing stays interesting forever.</p>
<p>You can see this in many ways. You may have a playlist full of songs that set you abuzz right now. A couple of months from now, it is a good bet that more than half those songs would have been replaced. A year from now, none of them will still be your favourites.</p>
<p>This is why we have the term “current favourites”.</p>
<p>Similarly for movies, you see an awesome movie and you go ga-ga over it. I kept telling everyone what an awesome movie “The Matrix” was. I only saw it first three years ago. Everyone had seen it a long time ago and weren’t all that excited. Next, I was raving about James Bond and Casino Royale. Then, something else… and the story goes on…</p>
<p>What happened? Is The Matrix not awesome anymore? Of course not. It is awesome. It’s just that I won’t feel as excited about it as I did during that initial honeymoon period.</p>
<p>Hmmm… Ok. So we know humans adapt. Can we use that to our advantage?</p>
<p>Instead of having a bunch of movies in our hard drive and letting them all suffer because of the Compare and Contrast effect, can we do better?</p>
<p>Can we just emphasize a couple of movies and delete the rest so that we can go ga-ga over these movies for the next couple of days/weeks/months? And then, when this honeymoon period naturally gets over, we delete these and get on to the next batch.</p>
<p>The point is, we don’t compare these movies with other movies.</p>
<p>What are we here for? We want to get entertained. Cool. We do whatever will maximize our entertainment (and artistic pleasure and crap).</p>
<hr />
<p>Ditto for books. Instead of letting our brain see all the hundred other awesome books and constantly comparing our current book with all the other awesome books (see Paper Warriors)…</p>
<h1 id="paper-warriors-and-paper-books-change">Paper Warriors and Paper Books (CHANGE)</h1>
<p>No testing - therefore, they are infinitely awesome. They can be as awesome as we want them to be. However, we’re testing our current book (by reading it and seeing if it is exciting / educational and stuff). So, the current book suffers.</p>
<h1 id="perfectionism">Perfectionism</h1>
<p>Notice how critical we are these days about movies?</p>
<p>We demand Perfection.</p>
<p>If a sitcom gets even slightly boring in one episode, we toss it aside and look for the next one.</p>
<p>If a book isn’t very humorous or punchy, we just throw it away.</p>
<p>If you have a hundred highly recommended books in your folder, and you pick up one and it is good but not epic-awesome, you’re gonna throw it away. Why? Because SURELY among those other hundred books, there must be something that is even more epic-awesome than this one. SURELY.</p>
<p>And so this book isn’t good enough. But then, nothing will be good enough (unless it is ultra-awesome, in which case it will seem to be merely good enough). Everything suffers from comparison.</p>
<p>Plus, every single book you pick up will seem worse than it actually is, simply because you’re being so critical and perfectionistic.</p>
<p>Nothing will be good enough. Life will become an endless succession of disappointing book after disappointing book. Disappointing movie after disappointing movie.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? When was the last time you said a movie <em>wasn’t</em> disappointing? Yup.</p>
<p>It may seem like a virtue. It may seem like you’re becoming an adult, you’re becoming so <em>refined</em> in your tastes that most things are not good enough…</p>
<p>But if you want to be entertained and have fun and if your “tastes” are getting in the way of having fun, then you aren’t refined, you’re an idiot.</p>
<!-- Add more stuff -->

<p>What does this do?</p>
<h2 id="savouring-the-experience">Savouring the experience</h2>
<p>First, it means that the only things we read are those that managed to grab our attention and keep it, out of the hundreds of options. Which means we’ll probably overlook books or movies that are actually a bit deeper, that require you to spend some more time contemplating it, maybe watching it over (after reading up more about it on Wikipedia and IMDB).</p>
<p>Example: Most people I know don’t even get the deeper significance of Pulp Fiction or Fight Club.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, it was kinda different. And yeah, it was funny and all… but it’s an ok movie.”</p>
<p>The question is not whether it is an “ok movie” or not, the point is - are you even judging it for what it really is? I’m no expert on movies. I’m not even trying to say I see things in movies people don’t. I am routinely shocked by the deeper analogies people bring out in stuff.</p>
<p>I only half-got the deep analogy in Life of Pi. I missed one huge analogy in Gravity (at the end, when she lands on earth).</p>
<p>Cool. When I learn about them later, it increases my enjoyment of the movie.</p>
<p>And that is all we want. This is NOT a race to see who can discover more and more obscure trivia about movies. That is not what we’re here for.</p>
<p>We want to experience the awesome emotions more, and if watching it more closely and paying it some individual attention and tender love and care will help us do that, cool. Let’s do it.</p>
<h2 id="the-secret-to-happiness">The Secret to Happiness</h2>
<p>The more important aspect of Perfectionism is that we end up have insanely high expectations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only thing you can’t be these days is have an experience that exceeds your expectations</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>– Thalaivar Barry Schwarz</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When was the last time you were pleasantly surprised and rocked by a movie? When did you last let a movie touch you?</p>
<p>(That was rhetorical, btw. Let’s not try to answer it by saying “Yeah, I was touched three weeks ago. I am a really good enjoyer-of-movies… blah blah blah…” - that way only lies trouble. [Link to Virtue post])</p>
<p>How can we have more such experiences?</p>
<p>We lower our expectations.</p>
<h1 id="willful-suspension-of-disbelief-needed">Willful Suspension of Disbelief (Needed?)</h1>
<p>We temporarily suspend our Artistic Critique that points out every single motherfucking flaw in the plot, the screenplay, the dialogue, the acting, the background music, the …</p>
<h1 id="opportunity-cost">Opportunity cost</h1>
<p>What’s more, every time you’re watching an average show, you will feel like kicking yourself. Why? Cos there are so many awesome shows out there (somewhere), and here you are watching this silly show that made you laugh only 2.37 times in the last 15 minutes.</p>
<h1 id="abnormal">Abnormal?</h1>
<p>Before you go off on a rant about how I’m “anti-progress” and anti-whatever and how I’m asking for impossible stuff, let’s remind ourselves of a bit of history.</p>
<p>Your childhood.</p>
<p>Let’s not depend solely on hazy memories. What does the data say? That is all we care about.</p>
<p>Were people way less happy back then? Are we riding a huge wave of happiness right now? What was the impact of all this easy access?</p>
<p>Research seems to show that people are now the least happy generation since the 1950s. Yup, people from the dull, boring, black-and-white era with big clunky low-def TVs and zero internet and zero Facebook were having more fun than us with all our TBs of HD movies and sitcoms and books and stuff.</p>
<h1 id="actions">Actions</h1>
<p>It would be pretty irresponsible of me to simply list out all the problems with such a deluge of easily available content without talking about ways to solve them.</p>
<h1 id="this-isnt-about-piracy">This isn’t about Piracy</h1>
<p>This is about the Low-Information Diet. Piracy is simply like a cheese-burger. It makes sure that people will never be able to stay on their diet.</p>
<h1 id="ps">PS</h1>
<p>I had to make a conscious effort to keep this personal. I didn’t want to talk about some abstract benefit for the reader. I wanted improvements in my own life.</p>

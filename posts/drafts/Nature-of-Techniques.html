<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: Why do we keep falling into the Technique Trap? Why don’t we just guide ourselves by empirical evidence?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="why-do-we-get-these-wrong-beliefs-in-the-first-place">Why do we get these wrong beliefs in the first place?</h1>
<p>There’s a deeper and detailed answer to this and I will be looking into it soon.</p>
<p>But, for now, I just have three words: <strong>Heuristics and Biases</strong>.</p>
<p>aka the human brain is screwed up.</p>
<p>We get predictably biased ideas about the world.</p>
<p>But, whatever the cause be, the important thing is that the screw-up does happen and we routinely mistake appearance for reality.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="the-nature-of-techniques">The Nature of “Techniques”</h1>
<p>Let’s look deeper at Naive Realism when it comes to “techniques”.</p>
<h2 id="salient-measurements">Salient Measurements</h2>
<p>First off, you won’t fall so hard for Naive Realism when you have salient measurements (i.e., in-your-face measurements). Like test scores in a college exam, or prizes in some competition.</p>
<p>Because the results are right in your face, you will find it hard to just keep thinking that you’re awesome and that you really understand the topics (or run really fast or sing really well). You would have to accept reality.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that people don’t come up with creative excuses for why their inner brilliance hasn’t been reflected in their performance measures. You and I probably use some of these techniques ourselves (“If I put my full effort at it, I can kick its ass.”).</p>
<p>But, other things being equal, salient measurements go a long way towards preventing damage.</p>
<h2 id="feeling-of-productivity-when-reading-about-techniques">Feeling of Productivity when reading about techniques</h2>
<p>Have you noticed how awesome you feel when you read a bunch of tips and tricks for how to live your life better? It doesn’t even have to be something immediately relevant to you.</p>
<p>I once read a post about 12 tips for keeping your house cleaner. Most of those tips didn’t even really apply to me. I was never really going to implement them. I wouldn’t even remember any of them when the time came. Yet, it felt so <em>f*cking</em> good when I read them. It was such a rush!</p>
<p>(Mwahahahaha ??? Superiority ???)</p>
<p>What happened? I believe I fell prey to Naive Realism. My mind felt like it understood the tips and felt like it had already gained the benefits from it. Never mind the lack of empirical results.</p>
<p>In our minds, Reading about a technique = Mastering a technique.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: Be very careful about what you read.</p>
<p>You’re not really getting anything out of it. It’s just make you feel good about yourself. And, worse, it’s preventing you from doing the work that will actually get you results.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-seem-open-minded">How to seem open-minded?</h2>
<p>Just agree with whatever new technique they talk about.</p>
<p>After that, don’t lift a finger about it. Nobody is going to look for empirical results. You agreed with them. You “accepted” the point. They heard you “accept” the point, which, by the Law of Naive Realism, means that you <em>actually</em> accepted the point.</p>
<p>Which means you’re open-minded. Result! That’s all that matters. Why waste energy taking <em>action</em> about the technique? What does that have to do with an open mind, right?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="hypothesis-tests-net-potential-benefits-hypothesis-vs-rest-of-the-world">Hypothesis Tests: Net-Potential-Benefits Hypothesis vs Rest of the World</h1>
<p>An alternative hypothesis to the Net-Potential-Benefits Hypothesis is that you do judge in comparison, but on the basis of the benefits you think you have got from the technique, not on the future benefits - call this the Current-Benefits Hypothesis. This says you will try to maximize the benefits you think you have got, to the best of your estimation.</p>
<p>Let’s see how they fare.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Net-Potential-Benefits hypothesis predicts that despite having so many great techniques, evidence-backed or otherwise, there will be little or no measurable change in your performance. Seems right on. However, the other hypothesis predicts this too. They both know everybody is a victim of Naive Realism. The key difference between the hypotheses is in how we compare.</p>
<p>The Net-Potential-Benefits Hypothesis predicts that you’ll constantly remind yourself of the “techniques” you know when comparing with others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look at those dumbasses. They don’t even know technique X, let alone Y and Z. I am better than them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have probably done this at some point of time or another, especially when faced with someone who threatens to be just as good as you. You whip out your list of “techniques”. And, in most cases, it won’t be about the empirical performance differences, it will be about the mere fact that you “know” this technique and they don’t. The Current-Benefits Hypothesis can’t explain this. It can explain comparing on the basis of past performance, but not on the future benefits.</p>
<p>The Net-Potential-Benefits Hypothesis predicts that you will go on looking for newer and more awesome “techniques”, rather than actually apply the techniques you think you have. If you were trying to maximize the benefits you have got, you would be applying your techniques as much as you can, putting in as much effort here as you put in searching for new techniques. Nope. This seems to rule out the Current-Benefits Hypothesis.</p>
<p>A variant of the that Hypothesis could be that you mistakenly <em>think</em> you have applied your technique a lot and got a lot of benefits from it and thus have a coloured picture of your Current Benefits - the Mistaken Current-Benefits Hypothesis. Another one could be that you compare based on your current benefits with your potential benefits as the tie-breaker - the Tie-Breaker Hypothesis.</p>
<h2 id="tie-breaker-hypothesis-vs-net-potential-benefits-hypothesis">Tie-Breaker Hypothesis vs Net-Potential-Benefits Hypothesis</h2>
<p>One Differing Prediction is what happens if X’s Current Benefits are higher than Y’s, but Y’s Net Potential Benefits are much higher than X’s? The Tie-Breaker Hypothesis says that you should feel X is better than Y, whereas NPB says you should feel Y is better than X.</p>
<p>What actually happens? Let’s take a real example.</p>
<p>Have you ever felt superior to somebody who is way richer or more successful than you (more current benefits) but who doesn’t have some “powerful” technique you have? Say they believe in some dumb things or aren’t aware of the Scientific Method or Deliberate Practice or whatever. Do you feel you are better than them?</p>
<p>I have felt that several times. I get the <em>feeling</em> that I could easily outpace such people with my “powerful” techniques, if I chose to enter that field. Of course, I will probably suck balls at it if I ever do, but the feeling persists. The scientific term for this is, of course, the empty brag. TODO</p>
<p>I think this rules out the Tie-Breaker Hypothesis and supports the Net-Potential-Benefits Hypothesis.</p>
<p>In fact, I think this rules out the Mistaken Current-Benefits Hypothesis too. In my example, I didn’t believe I had already <em>done</em> stuff comparable to what that successful guy had. I was comparing based on the insane potential benefits my “powerful” techniques could give me.</p>
<h2 id="continuing">Continuing</h2>
<p>Does the NPB Hypothesis say that we don’t compare based on current accomplishments at all? It seems to.</p>
<p>What if X and Y know the same “techniques”, but X has got more Current Benefits so far? The Net-Potential-Benefits are the same.</p>
<h1 id="the-superiority-hypothesis">The Superiority Hypothesis</h1>
<p>This was the most shocking ramification of Naive Realism that I discovered as things got clearer.</p>
<p>You feel like you have got some new technique. Therefore, you feel you have got benefits from it. (even though empirically you may have got none)</p>
<h2 id="constantly-make-yourself-feel-superior">Constantly make yourself feel superior</h2>
<p>You’ll constantly use the “technique” you possess to make yourself feel superior to others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look at those dumbasses. They don’t even know technique X, let alone Y and Z. I am better than them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may not be saying this out loud, but this will give you a good feeling, a nice buzz.</p>
<p>Worse, the fact that you feel superior will make your mind feel like it <em>really</em> has understood the “technique” and got benefits from it. Which will make you feel even more superior when compared to the dumbasses who have no clue about this. This vicious cycle just keeps spinning.</p>
<p>In the end, you have zero incentive to actually use the technique or check the empirical results. If feeling superior to others is your major breadwinner, you wouldn’t want to jeopardize that by actually testing it out and opening yourself up to failure (and loss of superiority). This explains why people might read through a programming textbook without ever running a <em>single</em> line of code from it.</p>
<p>I mean, seriously, how many times have I used Epic Techniques like the Scientific Method and Deliberate Practice and stuff? I keep beating their drums all day in my essays, but how many times have I actually used them?</p>
<p>Answer: Practically <strong>never</strong>!</p>
<p>So, you feel like you have understood and benefited from the “technique” (thanks to Naive Realism) and you keep feeling superior in comparison to the ignoramuses. These, and other biases, keep us perpetually locked in the state of “never going to make any empirical changes”. Sounds a lot like human behaviour, right? Read on.</p>
<h2 id="up-up-and-away">Up, up, and away!</h2>
<p>Turned up to Eleven effect: If this is nothing keeping you honest, you can make the benefits of Technique X be anything.</p>
<p>Happy Death Spiral - You can spiral it into Epic Awesomeness.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: Ordinary, empirical techniques will have a hard time competing with these Super Epic Awesome techniques. Ordinary techniques have to be constrained by their empirical evidence. Epic Awesome Techniques do not. Thus, they’re going to win any shootout.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson</strong>: For future reference, this is what happens when you let techniques proliferate without evidence.</p>
<p>You learn more and more “techniques” to feel superior and no longer have any motivation to DO some actual application or practice.</p>
<h2 id="what-shall-we-do-next">What shall we do next?</h2>
<p>Hmmm… So, you get a reward of feeling superior when you “learn” a “technique”. What’s that gonna make you do? Go and “learn” more “techniques”, of course.</p>
<p>Who cares about checking the techniques for empirical results? You feel like you already got it (Naive Realism).</p>
<p>You’ll keep reminding yourself of all the great “techniques” you have and make yourself feel better.</p>
<h2 id="blinded">Blinded</h2>
<p>Maybe your sense of superiority blinds you to your own flaws while making others’ flaws only too obvious.</p>
<h2 id="my-preciousss">My Preciousss!</h2>
<p>You’ll try to hoard your knowledge lest someone else should “learn” it too and erode your “advantage”.</p>
<p>PG says that ideas are worthless. Why? Cos it’s in the implementation, not in the idea. Just knowing the theory behind a technique doesn’t give you much. You need to know exactly how to implement it.</p>
<h2 id="i-can-do-whatever-i-want">I can do whatever I want</h2>
<p>You will use the above superiority trick pervasively when you’re an autodidact and nobody is learning that thing around you.</p>
<p>This runaway, unjustified superiority will be rampant when you’re learning stuff by yourself and there are no empirical tests to judge you, or other people to compare against.</p>
<p>TODO</p>
<h2 id="selling-superiority">Selling Superiority</h2>
<p>Ok. So we now suspect that we don’t use techniques for their benefits, but rather for the feeling of superiority we get.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: People aren’t selling techniques. They’re selling superiority.</p>
<p>All those bloggers, lifehackers, lifestyle-designers, how-to magazine writers, and non-fiction authors. They’re selling you means for feeling superior to others. They probably don’t use those “techniques” and neither will you.</p>
<p>It’s not “this technique will increase your productivity by X units”, but “this technique will give you <em>superiority</em> worth X units.”</p>
<h2 id="you-should-check-this-out---sharing-for-superiority.">“You should check this out!” - Sharing for Superiority.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Check out this movie. It’s awesome.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“You haven’t watched that TV show?! Hey, you’ve missed out on a lot of joy. You <em>have</em> to watch it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hidden implication of those statements: If you haven’t watched that TV show (or read that book or learnt about that “technique”), your life is significantly worse than mine. And, therefore, if I have watched the show, my life is significantly better than yours.</p>
<p>Even though there is almost ZERO empirical difference in your quality of life because of the show (or book or “technique”).</p>
<p>It’s just to make yourself feel superior.</p>
<hr />
<p>What’s the point of having a source of potential superiority if you don’t flex it?</p>
<p>People pretty much always have too much on their plate. Pretty much guaranteed to <em>not</em> take up your call for action.</p>
<p>You get to feel superior cos now they know that you “know” this and thus you get to be in their face. Every time you need a bit of a boost, you can just remind them about that technique and they’ll say they haven’t got around to it. You get to feel sorry for them and feel awesome about yourself.</p>
<p>Plus, you get to pontificate about how other people are not open-minded at all (unlike you).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Major Smell: “You should check this out”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Implicit: “I did. If you don’t, that means I have put one over you.”</p>
<p>As usual, you don’t even have to master the technique or actually apply it in places or even have a real technique at all. All you have to do is believe you have a technique and make <em>them</em> believe you have a technique and you’re done. Feeling of superiority guaranteed.</p>
<p>I think there is unilateral superiority (you think you know and you think they don’t and they don’t know whether you know or not) and bilateral superiority (you think you know and you think they don’t and they think you do and they don’t.)</p>
<p>Ever wanted to punch a guy who’s pushing some movie on you and saying that you “have to watch this”? This was probably why. He was using his “knowledge” of the “technique” to feel superior and make you feel inferior.</p>
<h2 id="evaporation">Evaporation</h2>
<p>Super-strong evidence: Write about the most powerful techniques you can think of.</p>
<p>Why did the awesomeness of the techniques evaporate the <em>moment</em> I wrote essays on them?</p>
<h2 id="self-improvement">Self-improvement</h2>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: People who care a lot about “self-improvement” (hint hint) and who get very excited about “techniques” are people who’re using those “techniques” to feel superior to others.</p>
<p>Look to your left. Look to your right. Look at me. Then, look in the mirror.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>How we should share</strong>: Implement it, get the results, and then show the <em>results</em> to people. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>Empirical evidence.</p>
<h2 id="the-scientific-thinker">The “Scientific” Thinker</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hey, I saw it in a peer-reviewed journal. F*ck you. I win.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn’t matter if <em>someone else</em> has got empirical results using the technique. Do <em>you</em> <em>actually</em> possess the technique?</p>
<h1 id="the-envy-backlash">The Envy Backlash</h1>
<p>Naive Realism isn’t all about making yourself feel better, though.</p>
<p>All the envy you felt towards others was about the “techniques” they knew of (and were thus superior to you).</p>
<p>This will stop you from entering domains where you might actually have made a big difference. You will think that you’re nothing compared to those guys.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: You don’t need to be scared of anyone who claims to “know of” / “have mastered” certain techniques.</p>
<p>EE or GTFO!</p>

		Give concrete examples here.

	+ Say you have a technique ONLY when you can actually execute it and get measurable benefits.

	In short, your beliefs about the efficacy of a technique, your usage and mastery of it, and your claims about the world should be *exactly* as specified by the empirical evidence. Caveat.

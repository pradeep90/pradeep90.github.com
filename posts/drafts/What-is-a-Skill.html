<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What skills do we have? Is “The Scientific Method” a skill? Is “Deliberate Practice” a skill?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="impact-not-definitions">Impact, not Definitions</h1>
<p>We don’t care about the “definition” of skill. We care about the Impact it gets us.</p>
<h1 id="what-do-we-expect-to-see-when-we-say-skill">What do we expect to see when we say “skill”?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Skill = Patterns of behaviour that increase Performance empirically</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, Skill involves actually doing (or thinking about) something.</p>
<p>There are certain kinds of behaviour in certain situations that increase performance. We want to be able to produce those behaviours on demand.</p>
<p>We don’t care about actions that <em>don’t</em> increase performance. In fact, we want to avoid them as much as possible. We want to be efficient.</p>
<p>Note that there might be actions that increase the chances of making something happen, even something really hard, but useless. People might get caught up in asking whether it is really a “skill” or not. We don’t care either way. We just focus on those actions that will increase performance. We leave the rest for the Guinness Book of World Records.</p>
<h1 id="empiricism">Empiricism</h1>
<p>The most important part, however, is that our behaviour should <em>empirically</em> increase performance. That’s just a fancy way of saying that it should <em>actually</em> increase performance, as per some reliable Measurement tool, instead of just making you <em>feel</em> like it did. This condition rules out a surprising number of “skills”.</p>
<h1 id="discovering-skills">Discovering Skills</h1>
<p>Ok. So, that sounds great. We want to have skills. Where can we get some?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Skill = Patterns of behaviour that increase Performance empirically</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some fundamental questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Where do we want to increase our Performance?</p></li>
<li><p>How do we measure Performance in those areas?</p></li>
<li><p>What patterns of behaviour <em>apparently</em> increase Performance in those areas?</p></li>
<li><p>Do they <em>really</em> increase Performance?</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="domains">Domains</h1>
<p>We want to do the maximum good possible. We want to get as many utilons as we can.</p>
<p>How do we get utilons?</p>
<p>(<em>left as an exercise for the reader.</em>)</p>
<hr />
<p>I think we can agree that it would either require creating a lot of wealth and using it to improve the world (by donating it to effective charities, say) or inventing new ways to directly make the world better (curing diseases, making technologies more efficient, etc.).</p>
<p>Currently, I believe that one path to making those things happening is to solve some Big Problems standing in our way. I may be wrong here, but I think that we need to become better in the areas of generating Motivation, finding out the Truth, and being able to acquire Skills faster.</p>
<p><a href>Akrasia</a> - weakness of will, going against our best intentions - affects us all. We are all familiar with the experience of not doing something even when you know it is the best thing for you to do. There are so many things we know how to do, we just aren’t doing them.</p>
<p>We suck at discovering the Truth (aka <a href>Predictive Power</a>) about things. We are constantly making wrong predictions because of unhelpful Heuristics and Biases. Getting high Predictive Power is the name of the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paul Graham - 1% of what we could be doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, being humans, it’s not enough for us to simply <em>know</em> some procedure. That isn’t enough for us to be able to replicate it. We need to actually do stuff to make it part of us. We need to <a href>acquire</a> the Skill and burn it into our brain.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hmmm… So, my hypothesis is that by increasing our performance in these areas, we’ll be able to get more utilons - i.e., make the world better.</p>
<p>Ok. So, for now, these are the major domains where I want to increase our performance. Let’s just fix it for the moment, so that we can take some concrete actions. We can always amend it based on the evidence we collect.</p>
<p>So - Motivation, Skill, and Truth.</p>
<p>How valuable is it to work on the problems in these domains and increase performance?</p>
<p>That would depend on the benefits we can get through these areas. How much would it benefit us if we did 10% more of the stuff we know we should do but don’t really feel like doing? How much would it benefit us if we could efficiently increase our skills by 10% in areas we care about (public speaking, piano-playing, programming)? How much would it benefit us if we could get 10% more Predictive Power in important areas of life (exams, problem-solving at work, problem-solving in personal life, etc.)?</p>
<p>I get the <em>feeling</em> that it would be really important to work on these areas. However… that is just a feeling. I need to find out empirical evidence as to the actual benefits. I hope to do that in a later essay.</p>
<h1 id="performance-measures">Performance Measures</h1>
<p>Given that we want to find patterns of behaviour that increase performance (aka skills), we need to figure out the Performance Measures first.</p>
<p>How do you measure your ability to generate Motivation for some task?</p>
<p>[TODO]</p>
<p>Right now, I think your Motivation-generation skill is measured by the percentage of tasks you complete. Simply put, you need to do 10 things of a certain difficulty; if you do 6 of them, that’s how good you are. If you do 8 of them in a similar situation next time, then you’re better at generating Motivation (at least for those tasks). We want to increase the percentage of tasks we complete. Also, you get bonus points if you are able to generate Motivation for (i.e., do a lot of) tasks that other people procrastinate on. That shows that you are generating unusual amounts of Motivation.</p>
<p>How do you measure your ability to increase your Skill?</p>
<p>Well, say you want to improve your piano-playing skill. You test yourself <em>before</em> you start training. You do your training. And then, you test yourself <em>afterwards</em>. If you’re good at increasing Skill, you should have improved a lot in a given period of time. This should hold for pretty much any important skill you take up. Most importantly, you should be improving your piano-playing performance (or whatever) much faster than most others. I mean, if your Skill-increasing techniques are really good, you should be able to increase your skill as fast as the best in the field.</p>
<p>How do you measure your ability to increase your Predictive Power (i.e., ability to discover the “Truth”)? You should be able to make more correct predictions for some given set of events. In other words, your <a href>Prediction Score</a> should be increasing like hell. You should be able to get the correct answer for more questions, solve more problems, etc.</p>
<h1 id="mad-skillz">Mad Skillz</h1>
<p>Ok. We now have the domains in which we want to improve our performance. We also have snazzy new performance measures for them. Cool. All that we need now are some skills.</p>
<p>What are some patterns of behaviour that increase performance in these areas?</p>
<p>Several answers come to mind. One might say, “Use the <a href>Scientific Method</a>” to get more Predictive Power. Or, “Use the <a href>Motivation Equation</a> to help increase Motivation”. Or, “Do <a href>Deliberate Practice</a>” to increase skill.</p>
<p>They sound like some fine ways to achieve our goals. We know those techniques. It seems obvious that if we apply those techniques in our lives, we will definitely get huge performance increases. Right?</p>
<p>What’s the catch?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Skill = Patterns of behaviour that increase Performance <strong>empirically</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “empirically” part is the catch. It means that when we <em>actually</em> apply those “techniques” we think we have, we must get measurable Performance increase. However, when we try to do so, it doesn’t really work. We haven’t really got the huge Performance gains we expected. Where did it go wrong?</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Severely Counter Naive Realism and Taboo each domain and skill.</p></li>
<li><p>Discover empirical Skills. Practice the f*ck out of them.</p></li>

<li><p>You have to <em>personally</em> get empirical results. No excuses.</p></li>
<li><p>This is where most smart people get tripped up. We are skeptical about the techniques other people hand us, but not skeptical enough about our own understanding.</p></li>

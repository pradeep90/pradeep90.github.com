<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: How do we embark on a complex project?</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is a <em>very</em> rough work in progress.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Background</strong>: I took part in a “Hackathon” recently, where you aim to program for nearly two days straight. This got me thinking about dealing with complexity.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="the-hello-world-insistence">The Hello-World Insistence</h1>
<p>I’m not working on <em>any</em> project that does not have a working Hello World program.</p>
<p>It must actually run right here, right now. Not tomorrow. Not “I have the <a href>instructions</a> for it and I can figure it out somehow”. No. It should just work right away!</p>
<p>Getting a Hello World program running involves non-trivial work. Most possible programs don’t work at all.</p>
<p>This means that I will <em>only</em> edit working programs.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: Get to a Hello World first. Programming comes later.</p>
<p>There’s the part where you try to get a Hello World working and there’s the part where you program. Don’t confuse the two.</p>
<h1 id="always-have-a-working-system">Always have a working system</h1>
<p>We can generalize this: Always have a working system. Even if it is the most trivial program ever, make sure it still runs. That will help you more than anything else.</p>
<p>There’s the part where you try to get the system working, and there’s the part where you add functionality. Don’t confuse the two.</p>
<p>One is about firefighting, the other is about improving.</p>
<p>Wait. Let’s consider the opposite. When do I get confused between the two? When do I try to add functionality <em>and</em> get the system working at the same time?</p>
<p>Well, trying to get the system working implies that the system is “not working” right now.</p>
<p>When I try to do both, my efforts get diffused. They neither lead to a working system nor improvement. I would be better off <em>focussing</em> my efforts on one thing at a time.</p>
<p>If the system is working smoothly, then I can add functionality easily.</p>
<p>Hmmm… This comes down to Kent Beck’s idea of a Refactoring Hat and a Coding Hat. You make it <em>easier</em> to make changes, and then you make changes.</p>
<p>TODO: What about Steve Yegge’s criticism of the whole idea of Refactoring and how it can be an excuse for lazy programming?</p>
<p>What do we want?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Easy to get it to run - Instant start.</p></li>
<li><p>Easy to change.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, Planning is a necessary response to risk.</p>
<p>The Kent Beck way above actually goes along with what PG says about Rapid Prototyping. I think I just had Cached Thoughts about how awful and cultish all those XP and Agile methodologies were. Their techniques are now industry standard practices, and they have solid logic behind them.</p>
<h1 id="decouple-the-part-that-changes">Decouple the part that changes</h1>
<p>Principle: Encapsulate the part that changes and decouple it from the rest of the system.</p>
<h1 id="what-kind-of-changes">What kind of changes?</h1>
<p>The obvious next questions: What sort of changes are you going to make? How can we make those changes easier?</p>
<h2 id="programs">Programs</h2>
<p>Lots of things can change. That’s we have OOP, FP, etc. They try to encapsulate the part that changes and decouple it from the rest.</p>
<h1 id="test-instant-start.-no-firefighting.">Test: Instant start. No firefighting.</h1>
<p>You should be able to get in and start coding <em>immediately</em>.</p>
<p>You shouldn’t have to debug some earlier errors or comment some parts or change some configs to get it running again.</p>
<p>(This is a necessary condition. You need to satisfy more conditions than these.)</p>
<h1 id="counter-point-be-wary-of-over-simplifying-reality">Counter-point: Be wary of over-simplifying reality</h1>
<p>Life is messy. No amount of productivity systems or methodologies is going to change that.</p>
<p>You <em>cannot</em> be in control <em>all</em> of the time, or maybe even most of the time. And yet, that’s what all the systems aim to do - fit a complex reality into a simplified workflow that our puny brains can handle.</p>
<h1 id="show-me-the-code">Show me the code</h1>
<p>Enough of the theory. Show me a few concrete examples. Show me a lot, actually.</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="./The-Technique-Trap.html">Needless to say</a>, these are my own untested hypotheses.</p>
<p>Even if other people believe the same thing, we still need evidence to back these beliefs.</p></li>
<li><p>Long-term Thinking</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: Maybe periodically go through your programs and make sure they still run.</p>
<p>Should get easier with time (because they were all running a month ago). This is basically Long Thinking - Making each program run is the simplest way to keep your system up-to-date.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-peoples-ideas">Other people’s ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Kent Beck has this idea of a Refactoring Hat and a Coding Hat, and he asks us to swap between the two modes, never doing both functions at the same time. You code, then you refactor your code, then you code some more, and so on.</p>
<p>We can think of a Fixing Hat and a Coding Hat. You fix the system and get it working, then you Code (improve your system), and so on.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="surprises">Surprises</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Key idea: Doing both at the same time is inefficient.</p></li>
<li><p>Kent Beck: Make it easier to make changes, then make changes.</p>
<p>This should probably involve a cost-benefit tradeoff between making the change with the current system and making the system better and then making the change.</p></li>
<li><p>Two Hats at a project’s start: Get to Hello-World, then add function.</p>
<p>Why? Because it is (vastly) easier to make changes to a running program than it is to start from scratch. And the loss of morale from package-management hell or development environment setup can kill your project before it even begins.</p></li>
<li><p>Test: Instant start. No firefighting.</p>
<p>This is at any point of time.</p></li>
<li><p>Test: Do you have a working system?</p>
<p>Always have a working system.</p>
<p>Get the system working, then add function. Keep them separate.</p></li>
<li><p>Counter-point: Beware of over-simplifying reality.</p></li>
<li><p>Test: Which hat are you wearing right now?</p>
<p>Are you trying to do two things at once? Fixing the system <em>and</em> adding function?</p>
<p>It might work, but it won’t be efficient.</p></li>

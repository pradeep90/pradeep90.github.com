<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: Why am I writing a recap post? Why not just move straight ahead? What happens if you <em>test</em> someone’s understanding?</p>
<h2 id="being-judgemental">Being Judgemental</h2>
<h4 id="what-should-you-say-to-yourself-when-you-screw-up">What should you say to yourself when you screw up?</h4>

<li><p>A. You’re such a dumbass.</p></li>
<li><p>B. You suck! How could you make such a simple mistake.</p></li>
<li><p>C. Things are never gonna get better. I’m never gonna do anything right ever.</p></li>
<li><p>D. ???</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A bit of <a href="./Being-Judgemental-and-being-Low-self-esteem.html">self-compassion</a>, maybe?</p>
<h4 id="should-you-treat-yourself-different-from-the-way-you-will-treat-a-young-mentee-who-looks-up-to-you">Should you treat yourself different from the way you will treat a young mentee who looks up to you?</h4>

<h4 id="think-of-one-reason-why-being-judgemental-towards-other-can-be-bad-for-you">Think of one reason why being judgemental towards other can be bad for you</h4>
<p>Could it become a habit? So what?</p>

<h4 id="what-is-a-good-way-of-finding-out-whether-something-is-true">What is a good way of finding out whether something is true?</h4>

<h4 id="can-you-think-of-any-easily-accessible-general-purpose-test-you-can-use-to-test-any-concept.">Can you think of any easily accessible general-purpose test you can use to test any concept.</h4>
<p>Is it some top-secret test being developed at NASA?</p>
<p>Or is it available at the nearest WordPress account?</p>
<p>(PS: by now you should know the answer to the previous question. If not, cool. I was just <em>testing</em> you.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What happens when you force yourself to break it down into pieces and explain every single damn piece from start to finish to a neutral reader?</p>
<p>Could that help your understanding?</p>
<p>Could it give you a feeling of progress?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is that good?</p>
<p>Rhetorical.</p>
<h4 id="what-other-kinds-of-ideas-do-you-have-in-your-head">What other kinds of ideas do you have in your head?</h4>
<p>There’s the stuff that you think is clear. There’s the stuff you think isn’t clear.</p>

<h4 id="why-is-it-a-good-idea-to-write-regularly-about-ideas-that-are-important">Why is it a good idea to write regularly about ideas that are important?</h4>
<p>So that you can have chains of <a href="./Why-write-Blog-posts.html#what-about-the-rest-of-the-time">ins***ts about other important ideas</a>.</p>

<p>It is always an uphill battle for them.</p>
<h4 id="how-can-you-identify-when-youre-making-idealizations">How can you identify when you’re making idealizations?</h4>

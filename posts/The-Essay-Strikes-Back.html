<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: If ideas are worthless, why write essays?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="existential-crisis">Existential Crisis</h1>
<p>In <a href="./Old-Memories-and-Bottlenecks.html#ideas-are-worthless">Old Memories and Bottlenecks</a>, I came to the conclusion that Ideas alone are basically worthless.</p>
<p>A few days after that, when I re-read the post, I basically got into a bit of a crisis. If ideas really are worthless and essay-writing as I do it is all about generating ideas, what is the point of writing essays?</p>
<p>No, seriously. If ideas are worthless, i.e., you can’t expect much Impact from just an idea, then why should I put so much time and effort into writing essays?</p>
<h1 id="sample-problem-writing-for-others">Sample problem: Writing for Others</h1>
<p>(“Oh no! Not this shit <em>again</em>!”)</p>
<p>For the past few days, I’ve been struggling with a topic I want to write about. I was finding it difficult to write about it, because the ideas weren’t clear in my head. I wasn’t able to put all the topic ideas in order and create a coherent plan of action out of them. So, I hadn’t written anything.</p>
<p>At lunch yesterday, I decided to do the only thing I could - go through my past essays on writing and see if there was any nugget of advice in them.</p>
<p>Cool. I started reading the <a href="./What-is-holding-you-back.html#the-counter-attack">Counter-Attack</a> I’d given against crap excuses in “<a href="./What-is-holding-you-back.html">What is holding you back?</a>”</p>
<p>Why was I reluctant in the past few days to just write whatever I could understand about the “idea” I had? Cos I believed it was a “great life-changing idea”. Seriously.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When will you have the right to call something a great life-changing idea? When you see the Impact yourself. If it is really such a great “life-changing” idea, you should be able to see some sort of change already. What has your great life-changing idea done for you so far?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What has it done for me so far? Nothing whatsoever. No Impact at all.</p>
<p>The math:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was reluctant to talk about these ideas cos the probability of f*cking up was high and the high cost or responsibility of failing would fall squarely on me. Well, now, the probability of f*cking up is still high, but the cost is super-low.</p>
<p>What I have are no longer “life-changing” ideas, just plain-old ideas. In fact, hey, they don’t even deserve to be called ideas. They are just shoelaces. Anybody want some shoelaces? No? Cool.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>About how it will be unconvincing to others if I write at my current below-par understanding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yo, SPK! Wait a minute. You’re talking like your ideas are unconvincing just to these other people right now. Yo! These ideas are unconvincing <em>even to you</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What should I do?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So this is the state of the world right now. I have these <del>ideas</del> shoelaces with me. My best friends haven’t taken any action on them. The rest of the world hasn’t taken any action on them. <strong>I</strong> haven’t taken any action on them. <strong>How could it possibly get any worse by writing about it?</strong> Writing about it means that the ideas would potentially become more awesome and more convincing for me, my friends, and for the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The above lemmas mean that I’ve got <strong>nothing to lose</strong> by putting all of my <del>insane awesome ideas</del> shoelaces out there right now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How could it possibly get any worse by writing about it? Amen. That will be all.</p>

<h1 id="laughing-all-the-way-to-the-bank">Laughing all the way to the Bank</h1>
<p>The solution I got by reading my old essay is just incidental. What really matters is the lesson I drew from the whole episode.</p>
<p>Yes, ideas are worthless. Yes, it may even be a boon that we don’t remember them all.</p>
<p>But essays aren’t worthless. They form an <strong>Idea Bank</strong>.</p>
<p>Each of them contains a well thought-out, explicit chain of logic that leads to a good conclusion for some specific problem. Yes, I’m not gonna take action on any of my essays any time soon. It’s a guarantee. Nobody is holding their breath (not after this, anyway).</p>
<p>But, my past essays are for me what Albus Dumbledore was for everybody in the HP series - a source of good solutions. Got into trouble? Need help? Scar hurting? Wand turning on its own during mid-air battle? Ask Albus Dumbledore! He’ll know what to do! He always does!</p>
<p>When I need help on a problem, I need to look back at the essay I wrote about that problem and then take action on the solution. So, when I’m ready, when the time comes… the idea will be there, waiting for me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The thing I have to remember is that there’s a “right time” to learn something, and it’s different for everyone …</p>
<p>This is an important thing to keep in mind when you’re blogging. Each person in your audience is on a <em>different clock</em>, and all of them are ahead of you in some ways and behind you in others. …</p>
<p>Besides, I’m not ready to hear what you have to say yet. When I am ready, it’ll be in your blog.</p>
<p>– Thalaivar Steve Yegge, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs">You should write blogs</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>People aren’t ready yet… including the author of the essay! Writing an essay on some topic and actually taking action on it are two different things. I’m guessing it takes time for the ideas to sink in. It takes time to get to the point where you’ve worked up the motivation required - where you want to take action <em>right now</em>!</p>
<h1 id="living-up-to-their-name">Living up to their name</h1>
<p>Put your ideas in an Idea Bank, not in a <a href="./Old-Memories-and-Bottlenecks.html#the-to-do-list-strikes-back">To-Do List</a> of ideas. With a To-Do List, there is growing burden on your head and increasing guilt in your heart. With an Idea Bank, it is just all your precious ideas locked away, at your disposal when you finally need them, when you’re finally ready to take Action on them. No tension, no worries. No Chinta, only Money!</p>
<p>And this is how essays can keep up the great expectations we have of them. We want them to deliver Impact in our lives - else, they’re useless. Well, <strong>this</strong> is how we’re gonna get the Impact. We get to the point in our lives where we desperately want the solution to a problem. We are aching to get some good results and willing to take action. Now, we turn the pages of our website… Hmmm… the answer is right here! I wrote this shit ages back! Let’s go!</p>
<p>Am I in a situation where some guy is making me unbelievably angry and frustrated? Wait a minute… this is a classic <a href="./Revenge-or-Grow.html">Revenge or Grow</a> situation. Cool. I gotta press Grow. Why? <a href="./Why-take-the-high-road.html">Because</a>. How? <a href="./Road-to-the-High-Road.html">Here’s how</a>.</p>
<p>Do I feel like some guy is a complete dumbass who got his success without deserving it and is therefore unworthy of my respect? Wait a minute… How do we judge that? <a href="./Who-should-you-respect.html">Who should I respect?</a>. Solved problem.</p>
<p>Why continue on The Great 300-Word Experiment? Why write everyday? Why don’t I just take a break and “take action and stuff”? Well, <a href="./The-Great-300-Word-Experiment.html#requirements">here’s why</a>. Questions answered. Let’s get back to writing today’s essay.</p>
<p>Some guy at work thinks I’m a dumbass. He thinks I don’t have much fun in life or that I don’t do “crazy stuff”. I feel like listing out every single awesome crazy thing I’ve done in my life and f*cking wiping that smirk off his face. In fact, I feel like listing them out right here, just for general showing-off purposes. Hmmm… it sounds like a virtue - something I want others to think I have. I feel like impressing the other person. I feel <a href="./The-Need-to-Qualify.html">The Need to Qualify</a>. Nope. Won’t make that mistake. Shut Up and Move On.</p>
<p>And so it goes…</p>
<h1 id="put-it.-shut-it.-forget-it.">Put it. Shut it. Forget it.</h1>
<p>Yes, these are tiny little chunks of life. There are still vast swaths of problem-land yet to be conquered. But, these are now <em>solved problems</em>. I do not have to solve them again, ever. Once and for all, I have a solution. And I keep <a href="./The-Journey-So-Far-50-Essays.html#when-life-hands-you-lemons">upgrading</a> my solutions as I grow and learn more in life.</p>
<p>So, when the situation comes, I can behave automatically. I can just do the right thing without having to think twice. The reasoning is already there, and it is written to be understood by strangers, which means it will be eminently understandable by me (though it’s surprising how strange my own essays look after a while).</p>
<p>I was so disappointed with my essays because I hadn’t been taking any action on them. I was angry that they hadn’t been having any Impact on my life at all. Now I know better.</p>
<p>The Impact will come. It will come later than you hoped, but earlier than you expected. I hoped that my life would change for the better immediately. When that didn’t happen, I expected that I would <em>never</em> see any results at all. Nah. The wait is surely not 3 days, but it’s not 3 years either. Maybe 3 months.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure, once you write an essay about a problem, you don’t have to worry about that particular problem any more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lieutenant Dan got me invested in some kind of fruit company. So then I got a call from him, saying we don’t have to worry about money no more. And I said, that’s good! One less thing.</p>
<p>– Forrest Gump</p>

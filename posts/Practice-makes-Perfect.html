<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: How do you get to Carnegie Hall?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="practice">Practice</h1>
<p>K. Anders Ericsson, a stud-level Psychology researcher, did a lot of research on skill and expert performance over 30 years. Here’s what he found:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[E]very expert in every field is the result of around <strong>ten thousand hours</strong> of committed practice. Ericsson called this process “deliberate practice” and defined it as working on technique, seeking constant critical feedback, and focusing ruthlessly on shoring up weaknesses.</p>
<p>– The Talent Code, Daniel Coyle</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="the-elements-of-deliberate-practice">The Elements of Deliberate Practice</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Specifically Designed: It is activity designed specifically to improve performance, often with a teacher’s help</p></li>
<li><p>High Repetition: It can be repeated a lot</p></li>
<li><p>Continuous Feedback: Feedback on results is continuously available</p></li>
<li><p>Highly demanding mentally: whether the activity is purely intellectual, such as chess or business-related activities, or heavily physical, such as sports</p></li>
<li><p>It isn’t much fun</p></li>
</ul>
<p>(from Talent is Overrated: What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else, Geoff Colvin)</p>
<h1 id="ordinary-practice-deliberate-practice">Ordinary “practice” != Deliberate Practice</h1>
<p>Every skill is built up to the extent you do Deliberate Practice. There are some other factors - tons of Deliberate Practice is a necessary but not sufficient condition. But the key point is that ordinary “practice” != Deliberate Practice.</p>
<p>Doing something over and over again is not in itself gonna get you to high skill. That’s why all those people who have been working in some area for decades are still not experts despite having done stuff for thousands of hours. An average career spans around 80,000 hours (40 hours per week * 50 weeks per year * 40 years before retirement).</p>
<p>But evidently, number of hours put in is nowhere near enough to make you an expert.</p>
<p>It is not 10,000 hours of doing some random stuff over and over again. It is 10,000 hours of Deliberate Practice - struggle. It’s about fishing out those parts where you really suck and then doing activities that will strengthen you there till you become world-class at it.</p>
<p>In other words, 10,000 hours of doing what you suck at!</p>
<h1 id="proportional-growth">Proportional growth</h1>
<p>The data is pretty clear. There is pretty much no great performer who has reached mastery without Deliberate-Practicing like a possessed motherf*cker.</p>
<p>Note, of course, that you don’t need to do 10,000 hours for every skill. Skill level is proportional to the amount and quality of Deliberate Practice. So, for some small skill, you may invest a couple hundred hours and reach really good levels.</p>
<p>The 10,000 Hour Rule (or the similar Ten-Year Rule) is for overall skill in a field. You want to become a master-class violinist, or Sachin Tendulkar, or Roger Federer, or Messi, or Mozart, or whoever - you need to work real hard at it for years. Being a cricket batsman involves several sub-skills - cover drive, pull, hook, the helicopter shot, defense, etc. You need to Deliberate Practice each of them.</p>
<h1 id="the-road-ahead">The Road Ahead</h1>
<p>The good news is that Insane Awesome Skill may be within our reach after all. Keep Deliberately Practicing and your Power Level will keep going up. Yo, aspiring Rationalists, did you hear that?</p>
<p>The critical news is that it’s now or never. Biologically speaking, there is no time like your youth (especially your twenties) for building up Skill and becoming a Master. This is when your brain is most responsive to change. After twenties, it’s not impossible but still really f*cking hard. Plus, where the f*ck will you find the time to do all those thousands of hours of Deliberate Practice? You have a job and a wife and kids and whatnot and you have to put food on the table and pay for school and college and… dude! Give up!</p>
<p>In other words, after the age of 30, it is most probably Game Over. This is crunch time. Whatever skills you want to master in life, make sure you’re getting on them right now. You will pay a huge price if you choose to squander your time on crap stuff. Crap stuff like what? You tell me. How are you spending your precious time? There is a reason why it is said - “If Youth only knew; if Age only could.”</p>

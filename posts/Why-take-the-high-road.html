<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: Why take the High Road when someone hurts you? Why not press the <a href="./Revenge-or-Grow.html">Revenge button</a>?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="prelude">Prelude</h2>
<p>This is gonna be a quick post - full speed ahead, no editing while I’m typing, like I’d mentioned in my last post. Let the thoughts come out on their own.</p>
<p>Yo Boyz! I am start timer.</p>
<h2 id="the-high-road">The High Road</h2>
<p>When we last met the Angry Young Man in <a href="./Revenge-or-Grow.html">“Revenge or Grow”</a>, he was itching to take social revenge when someone had hurt him.</p>
<p>We saw the “benefits” of taking revenge on someone - they learn not to f*ck with you again, you feel really happy and self-righteous that you’ve made them pay, and you maintain your social status.</p>
<p>What’s not to like?</p>
<p>I had suggested that we might want to take the High Road instead of going down the Path of Revenge. What did I mean when I said you will be “<a href="./Revenge-or-Grow.html#consumed-in-fire">consumed by fire</a>” if you take the Revenge route?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try as you might to think about something else you care about, your mind will insist on obsessing about all the ways in which the other person has screwed you and how you can make sure they pay for it. And your mind will defend itself by saying that it is just about deterrence. Like, you know, hitting the baddies hard so that they know not to mess with you again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s say we agree that, yes, our mind will insist on thinking non-stop of ways in which we could have bitch-slapped that bastard who did X, Y, and Z to you. So what? Maybe that’s a good thing. Maybe that will drive us to take revenge for sure and thus give us all the benefits mentioned above.</p>
<h2 id="the-big-picture">The big picture</h2>
<p>We need to zoom out a bit here. Let’s see what’s really happening.</p>
<p>They hurt you. Your quality of life goes down by <strong>X</strong>.</p>
<p>You take revenge on them. Their quality of life goes down by some amount <strong>Y</strong> (we don’t really care about that directly). Your quality of life goes up by <strong>Z</strong> because of the benefits of self-righteousness, “I got you, bitch!”, and insurance for the future.</p>
<p>If <strong>Z</strong> &gt; <strong>X</strong> (as it appears to be), then we should take Revenge on them. Else, we’re left with -<strong>X</strong> quality of life, which is a bad thing.</p>
<p>But what if you lost an entire day of thought because your mind was completely hijacked by all kinds of emotions about the incident and the fire that demands justice? Could it be that you went into such a bad mood that you went and ate a full burger and french fries at McDonalds because “The whole day is spoilt”? Could you feel completely unable to do anything useful and intelligent (maybe write an <a href="./The-Great-300-Word-Experiment.html">awesome post</a>)? Maybe all you could feel like doing was watch some TV or just surf the web with no particular aim while stuff cooled down inside your head.</p>
<p>“So what? Everyone has an off-day.”</p>
<h2 id="fasten-your-seat-belt">Fasten your seat belt</h2>
<p>No! No <a href="./Regret-without-Action.html">Regret without Action</a>. If you know that you’re gonna have “off-days” in the future and you did nothing whatsoever to prevent them from happening, you have NO RIGHT to sit there and console yourself.</p>
<p>Yes. It has happened in the past. But that’s fine. Sunk costs. Ain’t nothing you can do about it.</p>
<p>“Maybe I won’t feel such anger and bad mood and stuff in the future? Maybe I’ll be chill like a monk and do awesome stuff…”</p>
<p>I’m telling you right now that you will have such incidents at least once a week (or maybe once in two weeks). It’s gonna happen. You’re human, you deal with other humans, shit happens, and you feel like punching their face in. It’s natural. It’s been happening regularly in the past. You know how frequently it’s happened before. What the f*ck makes you think it’s gonna change magically in the future?</p>
<p>You need to prepare for it. If you want to handle your life, you need to take responsibility for shit you do. And not taking precautions is shit we all do. It’s like not wearing a seat-belt despite the fact that your car has been getting into accidents every month for the last 5 years.</p>
<h2 id="the-top-idea-in-your-mind">The Top Idea in your Mind</h2>
<p>I’ll let Thalaivar Paul Graham take it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I realized recently that what one thinks about in the shower in the morning is more important than I’d thought. I knew it was a good time to have ideas. Now I’d go further: now I’d say <em>it’s hard to do a really good job on anything you don’t think about in the shower</em>.</p>
<p>– Paul Graham, <a href="http://paulgraham.com/top.html">The Top Idea in your Mind</a> (emphasis mine)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What?! What’s that got to do with Revenge or Grow? WTF, SPK? You picked the wrong quote.</p>
<p>Thinking is hard. Coming up with original thoughts is hard. We think a butt-load of thoughts everyday and most of them are the same old crap. Solving problems is hard. Clarifying ideas is hard. Understanding and applying new ideas is hard. Generating new ideas is really hard. That’s why we need <a href="./Why-write-Blog-posts.html">all the help we can</a>. It takes a huge mental effort to solve <a href="./How-to-crack-Hard-problems.html">Hard problems</a>, especially when you’re new. Just like it takes a super-human effort to not drop down like flies in a marathon and to actually reach the finish line.</p>
<p>That means you need to employ the full force of your mental resources against important problems you’re facing. And, like PG pointed out, that sort of abstract “making-connections” “things-clicking-into-place” thinking seems to happen at odd times. Times when we ought to be doing anything but thinking about stuff (like in the shower or while walking through the park). However, it seems like there can only be one Top Idea in your mind (duh). Which means, that if something else is occupying your mind, like the way that son-of-a-bitch treated you like shit, you can kiss all your insane awesome abstract Rational <a href="./Portrait-of-the-Writer-as-an-Ignorant-Fool.html">epiphanies</a> goodbye.</p>
<h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Don’t make excuses for the future</p>
<p>Fasten your rational seatbelt. If you can predict that you’re gonna do shit in the future, take steps to prevent it from happening.</p>
<p>Remember, <a href="./Who-should-you-respect.html">No Action, No Right to Talk</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t let enemy airplanes get into your airspace</p>
<p>aka Don’t let thoughts about Revenge and punishment get into your head-space.</p>
<p>Hey! How are they enemy planes? Aren’t they my thoughts? Aren’t they my planes?</p>
<p>If they drop bombs on you everywhere, set your mind-city on fire, and prevent any improvement of your mental civilization, how they hell are they your planes?</p></li>
<li><p>In other words, press the <a href="./Revenge-or-Grow.html#the-great-gardening-experiment">Grow button</a>.</p>
<p>Yes. We need more plants. Environmental-friendly and shit. Go green.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>PS</strong>: 45 minutes. 1200 words. F*ck yeah.</p>
<p>Lest it seem like I’m an <a href="./The-Double-Edged-Sword-of-Essays.html#what-can-we-do-to-counter-this">authority</a> on this issue, remember that the whole reason I’m writing about Revenge or Grow is because I struggle on a daily basis with this. I’m gonna kick its ass, though. No worries. When you have a Hard problem, you need to think deeply about it (aka write essays on it), take a buttload of Action on it, and learn from the best in the business (more on this coming soon).</p>
<p>Action? No Revenge button for the next week. Step on me. Insult me. Kick me in my metaphorical balls. Treat me like I’m a low-class mofo who is not even worth your attention. I will still press Grow. And <a href="./Portrait-of-the-Writer-as-an-Ignorant-Fool.html#main-takeaway-focus-on-growing-stronger">Grow</a> I will.</p>

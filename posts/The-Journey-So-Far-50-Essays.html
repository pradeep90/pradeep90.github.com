<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: How crap really is this website? Let’s find out.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="i-would-like-to-thank-the-academy">I would like to thank the Academy…</h1>
<p>Ella Pugazhum <del>Iraivanukke</del> Thalaivargallukke!</p>
<p>All Glory be to the <del>Lord</del> Thalaivars!</p>
<p>Special thanks to my director, cinematographer, and music director. I could not have done it without you guys.</p>
<p>Let’s take a trip down Memory Lane…</p>
<h1 id="evaluating-the-experiment">Evaluating the Experiment</h1>
<p>This is about The Great 300-Word Experiment. It’s been on for 8 weeks now.</p>
<p>What happened? Did it work? Did it help? Did it hurt? Did it live up to my expectations and more?</p>
<p>Thankfully, I laid out a few requirements <a href="./The-Great-300-Word-Experiment.html">a long time ago</a>. Let’s review them.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We want to build momentum with every piece we write</p>
<p>Yup. I pretty much never got out of touch with writing. I kept producing something new everyday.</p></li>
<li><p>We don’t want to set expectations too high</p>
<p>Yup. I never really got anxious about what I was gonna write or whether it was gonna be of good enough <a href="./Quantity-over-Quality.html">quality</a> or stuff.</p>
<p>Worst case, I could write some extremely short post - like “<a href="./Water-Water-Everywhere.html">Water, Water, everywhere…</a>”.</p>
<p>Even if I got stuck in the middle of an essay and wasn’t able to make any headway, I could always split it into two and publish the first part. I did this for the ongoing <a href="./The-Perks-of-Piracy.html">Piracy</a> series as well as <a href="./The-Big-Problems.html">The Big Problems</a> series.</p></li>
<li><p>We want to learn and discover in the process of writing</p>
<p>You betcha ass.</p>
<p>I’ve basically had all my major ideas <em>in the process</em> of writing the essays. Many times, I would note down ideas on my phone during work and stuff. But that would just be the beginning.</p>
<p>Of course, I could just be fooling myself. What does the data say? Well, I’ve added a PS section after many posts. Before I start writing, I note down the ideas I came with. At the end of the essay, I go back through the essay and transcribe the final ideas. The difference between the two, of course, has been generated <em>during</em> the essay. I often just leave out the original ideas cos I came across more interesting ones.</p></li>
<li><p>We want to write in such volume that we become better at writing</p>
<p>This is left as an exercise for the reader :P</p></li>
<li><p>We want to have lots of opportunities to tweak our process and improve on it</p>
<p>Yup. The process of writing and generating ideas and reviewing and stuff kept evolving. More on this below.</p></li>
<li><p>We want something fun and social</p>
<p>Well, yeah. I have been discussing the “ideas” on this website with my co-conspirator, Mr. Agent, and friend, Thalaivar SGG. It feels good to have other people read your essays and post comments and stuff. Fun and social.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-i-word">The I-word</h1>
<p>How do we judge the usefulness of something?</p>
<p>Yup. You got it. Impact.</p>
<p>What has the Impact of these essays been on my life?</p>
<p>Well, for one, they have taken me upwards of an hour each day.</p>
<p><a href="./Revenge-or-Grow.html">Revenge or Grow</a> was one of the most practical and impactful bits for me. It was directed at hard-case sensitive <del>pussies</del> people like me and, I think, it didn’t disappoint. I have basically not pressed the Revenge button in over a month after I wrote that essay. <a href="./Why-take-the-high-road.html">Why take the High Road</a> was actually the most important post because it gave me a solid reason in front of my eyes why I should press Grow - to safeguard the Top Idea in my Mind and prevent me from being consumed by the fire of Revenge.</p>
<p>The self-esteem and trust posts were both premature and pretty useless, I guess. Discontinued because of strong public pressure. Ditto for the Approval-Seeking crap. Premature and useless.</p>
<p>“<a href="./Who-should-you-respect.html">Who should you respect?</a>” was the beginning of the Impact Sequence and had quite an Impact on me :P. It showed me that respect was to be doled out based on the accomplishment, not the process. The ends, not the means. You made millions (without hurting others) by making some simple crap-ass social app that anyone could have made? You still get more respect than some “smart” guy who’s sitting on his ass in a cubicle in some company somewhere, doing nothing of use.</p>
<p>Thinking in terms of Impact made me “realize” about the errors I was making <a href="./Portrait-of-the-Writer-as-an-Ignorant-Fool.html">as a writer</a>. I had to <a href="./The-Double-Edged-Sword-of-Essays.html">repeat it</a> <a href="./Writing-for-Others.html">several</a> times before it <a href="./Stop-Fcuking-Around.html">got into my head</a>.</p>
<p>Till this point, I was kinda pulling my punches. I had avoided writing about problems that really mattered to me. With “<a href="./What-is-holding-you-back.html">What is holding you back?</a>” and “<a href="./Paper-Warriors.html">Paper Warriors</a>”, I finally blasted apart the excuses I was feeding myself and started off on the in-progress <a href="./Akrasia.html">Will Power Sequence</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I had to go meta one more level. I had an epiphany about what I should <a href="./Stop-Fcuking-Around.html#returning-to-the-mother-city">truly focus on</a>. And the next day, I had an <a href="./Cooling-Off.html">epiphany about all epiphanies</a> (tldr; Epiphanies are Evil). I write about <a href="./The-Big-Problems.html">The Big Problems</a> - stuff I thought was most <a href="./Old-Memories-and-Bottlenecks.html">worth</a> <a href="./Barriers-to-Entry.html">attacking</a>. That’s still going on.</p>
<h1 id="show-me-the-impact">Show me the Impact</h1>
<p>So, what has the Impact really been?</p>
<p>On others? None. Anyway, that stopped being my focus about a fortnight ago.</p>
<p>On myself? Well, I got pretty f*cking convinced that if you want to generate ideas, writing essays is the only way to fly! In my experience, nothing comes close. Not chatting or “brainstorming” with others. Not outlining. Not sitting and thinking and thinking and thinking. Nah.</p>
<p>When we chat with others or just think and think and think, everything will just seem more disordered. We will be left with nothing to show for it. Things will seem a bit too complex to handle. We won’t be able to fit all the details and chains of logic in our mind. And, so, our mind will see the problem as insurmountable or “best left to better minds” and just make us feel demotivated. We will give up and go do something else. Or, worse, we’ll latch on to some inferior, incomplete solution and convince ourselves that it works.</p>
<p>Outlining suffers from the problem of being too shallow, IMHO. We try to generate idea after idea like a monkey jumping from one branch to a nearby branch. It basically just looks at a few neighbours within a given distance before halting the search. I think we don’t get to discover deeper links because we aren’t forced to look at each idea in depth.</p>
<p>In an essay, you are forced to talk about each idea for at least a paragraph or two, most likely a whole section. You go at it from different angles, and maybe throw in a few analogies to help the reader out. What happens, I think, is that the idea is now so clearly and solidly established in your mind that you can make associations in a jiffy. The clearer some idea is, the better you can retrieve ideas that are deeply similar to it. You may remember some little bit you had read in a blog post somewhere. Or some other idea you’d been thinking of which is unexpectedly related to this one. You will be <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html">surprised</a> - and the essay would have done its job.</p>
<p>We humans are way too optimistic about our understanding of ideas. In an essay, you cannot get away with a mere “understanding” of the problem. You’re forced to be explicit about your chain of logic. You have to give more detail than you think you need. It will feel like you’re giving almost too much detail, too many examples. One sentence in your mind (“Brooding about other people’s barbs and insults is probably bad for me”) may come out to a whole goddamn essay on paper (“<a href="./Revenge-or-Grow.html">Revenge or Grow</a>”). But now, you will have almost over-learned the idea… in a good way! You will have understood it so well that it is just f*cking plain naked in front of your eyes - no more veil of magic, no parts in darkness. And <em>that</em> is where real understanding happens.</p>
<p>What should you write about? Things that you think you “understand”! Cos it is a 20$ bet that you really don’t. Write it out. It may seem obvious and drawn out to you, but if you can keep your eyes open along the way, you will come across roads going off to the side that you had never noticed before. Holy crap! There’s more to it than I had thought! Explore those little side-roads and you may just discover a whole new interstate highway network of ideas.</p>
<p>(In case it wasn’t obvious, I realized exactly why essays are superior to outlining only as I wrote the previous three paragraphs.)</p>
<hr />
<p>So, even if all I got from the first 50 essays was just the evidence that essays work for generating ideas, it was worth it. It’s like a kickass experimental new idea-seeking missile that was being tested in the lab. It works! All I have to do now is turn the missiles on the real problems and kick their asses.</p>
<h1 id="get-a-life">Get a Life?</h1>
<p>A certain Thalaivar SGG had asked me to write this essay. To make it more balanced, I should probably write about what is crap about the whole Experiment as well.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time working on the essays. A total of 70 hours so far, to be exact. 70 hours in 50 days comes to 1 hour 24 minutes on average per essay. 62430 words in total, so far. A median essay size of around 1200 words. Almost all the essays were started and finished in one session.</p>
<p>I wrote all these essays. The question is: should I have got a Life instead?</p>
<p>Well, you judge the cost of something by looking at what you’ve missed out on. What in the whole wide world would I rather have been doing?</p>
<p>You can get a hundred different answers for that by asking a hundred people.</p>
<p>I don’t know if writing a <em>long</em> essay every f*cking day will work for everyone. But, if you don’t have 20 minutes everyday to write 300 words on something important and impactful, then it doesn’t matter anyway.</p>
<p>Frankly, I have never been happier. Doing a lot of hard, focussed work dedicated to something meaningful is a huge part of a man’s life satisfaction. Work really is Worship. It just so happens that most of our jobs are crap. It’s like a singer who takes a day job as a music teacher so that he can work his way through all the auditions for the stuff he really cares about. One day, he’ll make it big as a professional singer and leave his day job and kick ass doing the stuff he really likes.</p>
<hr />
<p>The question we should be asking ourselves is not “What <em>can</em> I do?” or “What do I <em>want</em> to do?” or “What do <em>others</em> want me to do?”. The real question is “What <em>needs</em> to be done?”. That is all I will say for now. More on that later.</p>
<p>That said, I <em>will</em> use this opportunity to try out some more different ideas in the Experiment. Nothing is cast in stone here.</p>
<h1 id="when-life-hands-you-lemons">When life hands you lemons</h1>
<p>From the original experiment launch essay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re not going to hit upon the perfect writing plan on your first attempt. It’s not gonna happen.</p>
<p>You will make mistakes. You will try out things that don’t quite work.</p>
<p>You will also find some small things that work unexpectedly well. You will want to modify your process to include more of the good stuff.</p>
<p>You won’t have the opportunity to discover such bugs and gold mines and do something about them when you write once a week.</p>
<p>It’s hard to find patterns when the data is spread out over months and years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had initially planned to write so that others could learn. Ha ha ha!</p>
<p>I had initially planned to write essays in bits and parts and keep updating them with time. Ha ha ha!</p>
<p>I had planned in between to try publishing an essay with a delay, after editing/rewriting it. Ha ha ha! My mind craves the joy and rush of starting and taking an essay to its finish in the same day! It will not be denied closure!</p>
<p>I had initially planned to structure my whole post as a series of questions with little or nothing given away for free. Ha ha ha!</p>
<p>I had initially planned to make the readers think like hell. Ha ha ha!</p>
<p>I had initially thought writing complete essays each day would be too much pressure! (My exact words: “…we don’t want to impose <em>crap restrictions</em> like ‘write a complete post’, or ‘write 4-5 paragraphs’, or anything that adds extra pressure”). Ha ha ha!</p>
<p>Live and Learn, I guess! :D</p>
<p>All that matters is that I’m not making <em>these</em> mistakes now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.</p>
<p>– Linus Torvalds, the guy behind Linux (duh)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given enough essays, all thinking errors are shallow.</p>

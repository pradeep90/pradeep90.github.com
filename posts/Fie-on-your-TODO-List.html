<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: Why am I cursing your To-Do List? What do I have against To-Do Lists?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="unfinishable-business">Unfinishable Business</h1>
<p>In “<a href="./Biting-off-more-than-you-can-chew.html">Biting off more than you can chew</a>” yesterday, we saw that making too many changes at the same time will almost certainly doom you. Why? Every single task will drain you of Will Power and make it more likely that you will give up sooner (Remember the <a href="./How-much-Will-Power-do-you-have.html">radish-cookie experiment?</a>).</p>
<p>Here’s what I realized immediately after finishing that essay (on my way to the toilet):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will <strong>never</strong> be able to finish your To-Do list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ever. Don’t hold your breath.</p>
<p>I’ve been irked by the fact that there are <em>always</em> items left undone on my To-do list. No matter how well things are going, there’s always something left. Your finite Will Power won’t last all the way to the bottom of your To-Do List where you have added vague, fantasy-land tasks.</p>
<h1 id="cracks-in-the-bottle">Cracks in the bottle</h1>
<p>Not only will it remain incomplete, the very existence of a long To-Do List will make it less likely that you will succeed. It doesn’t have to be out there on paper or your smartphone app. Even if it is just at the back of your mind, it will cost you.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Less cake for more people. The more tasks you plan to take on, the more diluted your Will Power will become as you try to spread it around. So, you’re left with less for each task. Thus, more chances of giving up or failing to step on the accelerator at key moments.</p>
<p>Crucially, the very fact that you have to juggle all these commitments in your mind and make decisions at all time about how you want to spend your time will deplete your Will Power. It’s like a crack in a bottle. It’s only one drop at a time, but the bottle will be half-empty before you even know it.</p>
<p>It’s not just about the tasks you actually do. It’s about the decisions you have to make. You want to go take rest, but there are motherf*cking fifteen items still left on your To-Do List and you need to do them because they are important. Surely they’re important - they’re on your To-Do List, right?! The more you ask of yourself, the more you drain your Will Power budget.</p>
<h1 id="impulse">Impulse</h1>
<p>Am I being a pessimistic anti-progressive nay-sayer? Am I asking you to settle for less than your potential? Am I suggesting that you actually give up tasks that you considered valuable enough to put on your To-Do list?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I’m not even saying “have fewer items on your To-Do list”. I’m saying have less work scheduled, period. It’s not about the number of items you put there or the time you want to spend on them.</p>
<p>It seems to me like Will Power is basically depleted whenever you go <strong>against your impulses</strong>. This is my own conjecture. I’m yet to check it with some actual Will Power research. Will do that further into the sequence.</p>
<p>If that is true, it means that your Will Power drainage will be proportional to the amount of anti-impulse actions you take.</p>
<p>This means that even if you try to take on only <em>one</em> task, but a huge one, like becoming super-fit, it will still involve so many anti-impulse tasks (like not eating snacks, not drinking sugary soft drinks, and exercising every day) that you will still blow your Will Power budget and end up stuffing your face with snacks, washing it down with Coke, and watching a TV series marathon.</p>
<h1 id="stone-age-settlements">Stone-Age Settlements</h1>
<p>So, yes, we will have to settle. Taking on too much is bad for your liver, period.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, taking on too much is not just about what you write in your To-Do list. I personally haven’t maintained a daily To-Do list for years now. Those just don’t work. Why not? You tell me. How many times have you tried to keep a To-Do List. What came of it?</p>
<p>Rather, the real danger is that we may take on too much responsibility in our own minds. We may not say it out loud, but somewhere back there we have this notion that we want to have accomplished stuff in X, Y, and Z fields in the next couple of years.</p>
<p>I may not say it out loud even to myself, but I have this implicit agenda that I will become ripped by the end of a couple of years. It’s like girls in mini-skirts, you don’t even have to say it out loud. It’s just <em>obvious</em> that you wanna have that (the girls, not the mini-skirts). It is at the back of my mind every time I go to the gym. It is there when I curse myself for not having exercised regularly.</p>
<p>Ditto for my dreams of becoming a super-strong “rational” thinker (whatever that means). It’s there at the back of my mind at all times. It makes me feel bad when I’m doing crap like watching IPL matches and stuff. And I’ve already spoken about how I (used to) beat myself up for <a href="./Why-dont-I-go-to-bed-early.html">going to bed late</a>. The hidden agenda there was that sometime in the future I would be waking up 6am in the morning everyday, without trouble.</p>
<p>What do we do about this? Lots more on this coming up.</p>
<h1 id="moral-of-the-story">Moral of the story</h1>
<p>If you had any dreams of becoming insanely powerful in the future and accomplishing every single thing you want to do in life, forget about it.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="ps">PS</h1>
<p>Got more and more into the action as I kept writing. Lots more ideas coming up soon. Love y’all.</p>

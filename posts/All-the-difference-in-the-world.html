<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: How ashamed are you of the ways in which your life differs from that of most people? How proud are you?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="being-normal">Being normal</h1>
<p>How good is it to be different from others?</p>
<p>Is it desirable?</p>
<p>Should we try to be as different from others as possible?</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: What does it mean to be “normal”?</p>
<h1 id="normal-and-abnormal">Normal and Abnormal</h1>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: What are some major areas in which we care about a person’s behaviour?</p>
<p>Name three.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: In each of those three areas, what <em>is</em> normal behaviour? Name the default, accepted state.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Now, for each of those three areas, think of some “abnormal” behaviour - something that differs quite a bit from the norm.</p>
<h1 id="keep-it-normal">Keep it normal</h1>
<h4 id="q-what-are-three-advantages-of-sticking-with-the-herd---of-behaving-normally">Q: What are three advantages of sticking with the herd - of behaving normally?</h4>
<p>Could it be some form of pure emotional benefit?</p>
<p>Or perhaps in part due to some economic benefits?</p>
<p>Something to do with our evolutionary past, perhaps?</p>
<h4 id="q-it-all-seems-great-what-could-be-some-disadvantages-of-behaving-normally">Q: It all seems great! What could be some disadvantages of behaving normally?</h4>
<p>Could the difference between Eastern and Western culture shed some light here?</p>
<p>Could we look at the difference between the last 300 years and the 3000 years before that? What changed?</p>
<p>Has anyone ever come to great harm because of normal behaviour?</p>
<p>Or, to take things to their extreme, what if everyone everywhere were to act normally?</p>
<p>Wouldn’t we all be happy? Wouldn’t there be no more problems?</p>
<h4 id="q-hmmm-i-dont-know-what-this-guy-is-getting-at.-what-could-possibly-be-good-about-acting-abnormally">Q: Hmmm… I don’t know what this guy is getting at. What could possibly be good about acting abnormally?</h4>
<p>Wait. What really does it mean to behave abnormally?</p>
<p>What is normal behaviour? Or is that the wrong question?</p>
<p>Does time and circumstance have anything to do with it?</p>
<p>What was normal behaviour two hundred years ago in your country? Was there even a country?</p>
<h4 id="cmon-isnt-normal-behaviour-well-defined">C’mon! Isn’t normal behaviour well-defined?</h4>
<p>Isn’t the whole of history a march towards more and more normality?</p>
<p>Haven’t we struggled real hard to gain the normal life that we lead now? Why should we try to break it and live some stupid abnormal life? Being normal is good. I’ll convince you.</p>
<p>Blacks were enslaved a couple of centuries ago. That was abnormal. Now, they’re not. That’s normal. See!</p>
<p>India was ruled by the British a century ago. That was abnormal. Now it is independent. That’s normal. See!</p>
<p>Half of humans when never given the rights given to the other half. That was abnormal. Now, they can vote too. That’s normal. See!</p>
<p>Vast majorities of the world used to live in poverty and sickness. That was abnormal.</p>
<p>Now, they don’t? See!</p>
<p>People used to die for the most arbitrary of reasons - like stuff falling on their head, or slipping and breaking their neck, or having some disease that killed them slowly over years. People used to die for no rhyme or reason. That was abnormal.</p>
<p>Now, they don’t? See!</p>
<p>Everybody in the past used to die once they got old. That was abnormal.</p>
<p>Now, they don’t? See!</p>
<p>See?! Everything is better now, because everything is normal now. Everything is absolutely ok. Hunky-dory, even. Heck! It couldn’t be better even if we tried.</p>
<h1 id="wait-a-minute">Wait a minute</h1>
<p>Hmmm… Hey, dude, wait a minute… What’s so abnormal about dying when you get old? Sure, that used to happen in the past.</p>
<p>But, what’s wrong with that?</p>
<p>I mean, seriously, isn’t it even a good thing. They probably want to die, right?</p>
<p>I mean who wants to live on earth?</p>
<p>C’mon… Don’t we all want to just slip into oblivion? You know, let everything become blank. Finished.</p>
<p>That’s got to be fun, right? Leave everything you care about, never see any of your loved ones, never let them see you, be unable to do anything about anything ever again. Sign me up.</p>
<p>But I guess, in some way, death is probably a good thing, right? Only if you’re old, though. Before that it is a tragedy.</p>
<p>What’s that you say? What’s so special about old people? And what else?</p>
<p>Diseased people? What about them?</p>
<p>Why should they die, you ask? I mean, what can I say? They got the disease. What’s that?</p>
<p>Would I stop that from happening if I could? Well… I mean, c’mon… of course… who wouldn’t? But the point is we can’t. It’s not normal. Right?</p>
<p>I mean, how much can you try? Nature is always gonna win the fight, right? That’s how it’s always been. It’s normal.</p>
<p>And so we just give up without a good fight?</p>
<h1 id="the-beginning-of-the-rabbit-hole">The beginning of the rabbit-hole</h1>
<p>How deep does it really go?</p>
<p>And you thought this post was just about</p>
<ul>
<li>whether we should have a different diet from normal people</li>
<li>or about whether we should like the same kind of entertainment as normal people</li>
<li>or about taking flashy mini-retirements to brag about</li>
<li>or about holding on to some special beliefs that have made <em><strong>absolutely zero</strong></em> changes to your life but still make you feel superior to the people who don’t have them (Can you think of three in five seconds?)</li>
<li>or about whether [<em>insert some other way of differentiating yourself from the “normal” people and thus feel like you are <strong>superior</strong> to them</em>].</li>
</ul>
<p>That is not my concern here.</p>
<p>If that feeling of superiority is what you want, go check out the hundreds of blogs and “self-help” books that exist to pander to those desires and make you feel like a unique snowflake who is tragically misunderstood and snubbed by all the stupid idiots around him. They’ll make quite a bit of money from this too.</p>
<h1 id="what-does-it-really-mean-to-be-not-normal">What does it <em>really</em> mean to be not-normal?</h1>

</blockquote>
<p>It’s not like becoming an atheist when most people around you is a theist. There is a group of other atheists you’re joining when you become an atheist. It doesn’t take all that much of courage.</p>
<p>It’s about having the courage to stand up for something that you have seen to be the truth even though every single other person is shoving their head into the sand to ignore facing it.</p>
<p>This essay was originally gonna be about the first kind of non-normality - the normal kind of non-normality. I was gonna quote Paul Graham and take it from there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One sense of “normal” is statistically normal: what everyone else does. The other is the sense we mean when we talk about the normal operating range of a piece of machinery: what works best.</p>
<p>These two senses are already quite far apart. Already someone trying to live well would seem eccentrically abstemious in most of the US. That phenomenon is only going to become more pronounced. <em>You can probably take it as a rule of thumb from now on that if people don’t think you’re weird, you’re living badly.</em></p>
<p>– Paul Graham, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/addiction.html">The Acceleration of Addictiveness</a> (emphasis mine)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, as is usual with the whole endeavour of writing an essay, I came to understand better the true nature of the problem as I was writing it. Hey! Isn’t that <a href="./Quantity-over-Quality.html">why we write</a> in the first place?</p>
<h1 id="courage-and-support">Courage and Support</h1>
<p>So yeah, there are two kinds of non-normal behaviour. There isn’t a race or anything between the two. We need to do both, when required. We need to do whatever is right.</p>
<p>And yes, we will occasionally face quite a bit of shame, fear, guilt, low-status, sadness, depression, and loneliness as we go along doing more and more non-normal stuff, as we come to terms with how screwed up the normal way really is.</p>
<p>And, by golly, it would be great if we could support each other through that. Cool. Consider it done. Isn’t that why this site exists? :)</p>
<p>We need two types of courage:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One to do the normal non-normal things - stuff like taking up a better diet, having a “better lifestyle”, getting rid of religious beliefs, taking up better views of relationships, etc.</p>
<p>Nobody said that shit is easy. And there is a non-trivial payoff associated with all of the above. So, let no one play them down.</p>
<p>More essays coming up on doing those things (and identifying them first :P).</p></li>
<li><p>Another is on doing the non-normal non-normal things - stuff like …???</p>
<p>What non-normal non-normal things can you think of? Name three.</p>
<p>More on this coming soon.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What is holding you back from writing about your best ideas?</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is about all my “irrational” fears regarding writing about my “ideas”. Let’s hope we beat the shit out them by the end of this essay.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-are-you-afraid-of">What are you afraid of?</h2>
<p>Are you writing about the most important problems in your life? Are you tackling them head on? Or are you just writing about side topics, barely brushing the topics you really care about?</p>
<p>How much are you held back by your fear of how others might make fun of you? What holds you back from going forward at full power? Why are you not giving it everything you have? You know that even your very best may not be good enough. Then, why not test it out and see how good your ideas really are?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="excuses">Excuses</h2>
<p><strong>Excuse #1</strong>: I don’t understand those ideas too well myself. How can I write about them?</p>
<p>Yo! <a href="./Why-write-Blog-posts.html">Check yourself</a> before you <a href="./The-Great-300-Word-Experiment.html">wreck yourself</a>. Those are the very ideas you need to be writing about.</p>
<p><strong>Excuse #2</strong>: I understand those ideas well enough, but I can’t present them very well to others.</p>
<p>First of all, you don’t get to say you “understand those ideas”. Why not? <a href="./Who-should-you-respect.html">No Impact, No Right to Talk</a>.</p>
<p>Second, how the f*ck do you think you’re gonna get better at explaining things to others? By meditating under a tree for twenty years?</p>
<p>You need to keep writing essays about those ideas until (a) you see the Impact in your own life and (b) you “explain it well enough” so that others too start taking Action on it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ok. You know I was just putting up easy excuses and knocking them down. Here come the real-serious excuses.</p>
<p><strong>Excuse #3</strong>: I may screw it up for others by not being persuasive enough.</p>
<p>What the hell does that even mean?</p>
<h2 id="making-the-choice-nobody-else-can-make">Making the choice nobody else can make</h2>
<p>Say you have an awesome idea. In fact, say you have 5-6 of them. These are insane awesome life-changing ideas. You know it for sure this time. What do you do?</p>
<p>Do you just write a blog post about it and leave it at that? Or maybe a dozen blog posts on the idea?</p>
<p>Say you go around and talk about it all the time to all the people you know. It’s the most important life-changing idea you know of. So, obviously, you should spend as much energy as you can spreading the word. Think of how many people could benefit from this.</p>
<p>It’s like convincing a cigarette smoker to give up smoking. Your action could add a decade or two to his life. It’s that big of a deal. How can you just not do anything about it? Of course you have to go and try to talk sense into him.</p>
<p>What’s the problem?</p>
<p>Do you have a logical argument to make (smoking kills, period)? Do you have real-life evidence to back it up with (the lives of all the smokers out there)? If he knew better, would he take action on your advice (quit smoking)?</p>
<p>Yes to all.</p>
<p>What’s not to like?</p>
<p>What are people convinced by?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Logical arguments written out in Math-style proofs</p></li>
<li><p>Data collected from the lives of 10,000 smokers showing how they have suffered?</p></li>
<li><p>Documentaries backed by real-world research</p></li>
<li><p>A speech (on any topic) by Obama</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What happens if you present in a less-than-satisfactory manner? What happens to your idea?</p>
<p>Think about all the real great ideas you know of. They may not be life-changing and stuff, but they would be one-question IQ tests. You would have to be a fool to not do the right thing. Like what? AIDS. Simple unwanted pregnancies. Preventable diseases. Credit card debt.</p>
<p>Some problems in life are just unsolvable (now). For everything else, there’s rationality.</p>
<h2 id="a-fable-of-responsibility">A Fable of Responsibility</h2>
<p>Why hasn’t everybody taken action on these obvious ideas yet? You could argue that people are being “irrational” and stuff, that they aren’t thinking logically, that they are letting their ego rule them, that they don’t want to think hard about stuff and actually take some action. Cool. Here’s a story.</p>
<p>You take a glass of iced lemonade and sit on a lawn chair outside late in the afternoon (reading this blog on your tablet). After five minutes, you find that the ice has melted.</p>
<p>“Damn Sun! Melted my goddamn ice.”</p>
<p>You get back inside and throw some more ice cubes into your glass. Five minutes later, you find that the ice has melted.</p>
<p>“Damn Sun! Keeps melting my goddamn ice.”</p>
<p>You get some more ice. It melts too. You curse again. You get some more ice.</p>
<p>What’s the problem here? Is there any point assigning any responsibility to the Sun for melting your goddamn ice? Why? Cos the Sun’s nature is not gonna change <em>any time soon</em>.</p>
<p>And neither is people’s nature. Don’t hold your breath.</p>
<h2 id="for-everything-a-place">For everything a place</h2>
<p>Where should you place responsibility? On the only thing that can change. You.</p>
<p>You’ve gotta stop putting your goddamn ice lemonade out in the sun where it gets melted again and again and again.</p>
<p>Similarly, you’ve gotta stop pushing your idea on people where it gets rejected again and again and again.</p>
<p>You need to change your methods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”</p>
<p>– Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-real-danger">The real danger</h2>
<p>Is that the only problem? Ok. Maybe I can try something different the next time. And if that fails, try something else after that. And again.</p>
<p>What happens when you make a suggestion to someone and they reject it? How will their reaction be when you go to them next time with another suggestion? What happens on the third suggestion?</p>
<p>People are slow to forgive, I think. In this world, sadly, first impressions matter way too much. The cover of the book may be the only thing people judge it by. Once their door is shut, no matter how much of a kickass argument you come with the next time, you’re gonna have a hard time getting them to open up.</p>
<p>And it won’t just be you. They won’t listen to anybody else who comes with that idea. It’s like they’ve got a bullshit shield raised against that particular idea.</p>
<p>“Don’t eat high-fat, high-sugar, processed foods” - “Get lost. I want to eat this burger.”</p>
<p>“Brush twice a day” - “Get lost. Only idiots do that.”</p>
<p>“Exercise regularly” - “Dude. Get lost. I have better things to do.”</p>
<p>“Write essays regularly” - “Get lost. Only dumb-asses write ‘essays’.”</p>
<p>“[Insert any <a href="./All-the-difference-in-the-world.html">non-normal idea</a> here]” - “Get lost. Only idiots will do that (doesn’t matter what it is).”</p>
<p>Say you come up to them later with mountains of data showing how people are becoming fatter and fatter and how that is affecting their health. What happens? Will they listen?</p>
<p>“Get lost, dude.” Or, “I don’t care, da. I like this food. What’s your problem?”</p>
<p>The real danger is that you will forever turn them against an idea that could actually improve their lives like hell. And whose fault will it be? The Sun’s or the lemonade-drinker’s?</p>
<p>So, yeah. That is what I’m most afraid of. Phew! Feels so good to get it all out there. I can talk about it freely now.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-counter-attack">The Counter-Attack</h2>
<p>You knew it was coming.</p>
<p>First, I’ll let my inner Yo-voice take the stage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yo, SPK! What the f*ck do you mean by “great life-changing idea”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When will you have the right to call something a great life-changing idea? When you see the Impact yourself. If it is really such a great “life-changing” idea, you should be able to see some sort of change already. What has your great life-changing idea <a href="./What-has-your-Rationality-done-for-you.html">done for you so far</a>?</p>
<p>So, how many great “life-changing” ideas do I really have? None.</p>
<p>I was reluctant to talk about these ideas cos the probability of f*cking up was high and the high cost or responsibility of failing would fall squarely on me. Well, now, the probability of f*cking up is still high, but the cost is super-low.</p>
<p>What I have are no longer “life-changing” ideas, just plain-old ideas. In fact, hey, they don’t even deserve to be called ideas. They are just shoelaces. Anybody want some shoelaces? No? Cool.</p>
<h2 id="the-pain-of-loss">The pain of loss</h2>
<p>Wait. Yo-voice has something more to say. Take it away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yo! How many people are gonna read your essays now?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pretty much nobody. Hence, anybody who reads them is gonna be in the future. I can keep improving my ideas over and over and then present only the final ultra-persuasive ultra-awesome versions to the future readers (if any).</p>
<p>Wait a minute. (You should replace “SPK” with “bitch” when Yo-voice talks)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yo, SPK! Wait a minute. You’re talking like your ideas are unconvincing just to these other people right now. Yo! These ideas are unconvincing <em>even to you</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When do we call an idea “unconvincing”? An idea is “unconvincing” when it has had absolutely no Impact on your life. Hey, even <em>you</em> haven’t taken any Action on your ideas. So Shut the F*ck Up already, “SPK”.</p>
<p>So this is the state of the world right now. I have these <del>ideas</del> shoelaces with me. My best friends haven’t taken any action on them. The rest of the world hasn’t taken any action on them. <strong>I</strong> haven’t taken any action on them. How could it possibly get any worse by writing about it? Writing about it means that the ideas would potentially become more awesome and more convincing for me, my friends, and for the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The above lemmas mean that I’ve got <strong>nothing to lose</strong> by putting all of my <del>insane awesome ideas</del> shoelaces out there right now.</p>
<h2 id="collateral-damage">Collateral Damage</h2>
<p><strong>Excuse #31</strong>: People will look at these incomplete poorly-formed larval ideas and make fun of them / me. And then, they won’t take them / me seriously again.</p>
<p>Yes, they will do that. So what?</p>
<p>Here’s the kicker: how many people are gonna make fun of it right now?</p>
<p>Let’s assume I’ve got it within me to refine my ideas and get them to transform from larvae into beautiful butterflies (or better, awesome Hungarian Horntails).</p>
<p>Then the <em>only</em> people who will be able to make fun of the dumb version of my ideas will be the ones who see it before I get the ideas to the Horntail stage.</p>
<p>How long will it take me? A couple of months? Hmmm… I get the feeling the only way I would be able to “clarify the ideas” would be by taking insane Action on them and actually seeing the Impact in front of my eyes. Else, it is all butt-in-the-armchair reasoning. Mental masturbation. I would need to take a lot of action, test the ideas, throw out the crap, and improve at each step.</p>
<p>Ok. Say it takes me a couple of years. How many people would come across my essays before then? Five. Max six. Ok, best case, a hundred.</p>
<p>I can take that loss. Hundred people who are forever turned against the awesome ideas I’ve learnt just because I presented them badly. Hundred people who will make lots of fun of me, and laugh at how I’m simultaneously writing absolute crap and expecting to get “insane awesome” results in the future. Just the way you’d laugh at a shoeshine boy who swears he’s gonna become a millionaire in the future.</p>
<p>Cool. That’s par for the course. It’s a reasonable price to pay for the insane awesome results I’m gonna get (there I go again). It’s a bargain, in fact. Just need to tolerate a few titters from the crowd for a while and then, if things go well, bam! Hungarian Horntail out of nowhere.</p>
<h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>
<p>What is the upshot?</p>
<p>I’m gonna write about the most important <del>ideas</del> shoelaces in my mind right away. Come what may. It’s just the first version.</p>

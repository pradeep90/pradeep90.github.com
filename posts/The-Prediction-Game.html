<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What does it mean to make a <em>prediction</em>?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="casino-royale">Casino Royale</h1>
<p>We say someone <a href="./Truth-Predictive-Power.html">knows the Truth</a> when he makes accurate Predictions.</p>
<p>Prediction is nothing but placing your bets on the different possibilities. It’s a betting game. In each round, you have 100 points. You have to spread 100 points among different possible outcomes.</p>
<p>Say, you’re predicting what will happen on the next ball - Dhoni will hit a six, Dhoni will get clean-bowled, Dhoni will take a single, etc. You have to spend all the points, you can’t keep any with you.</p>
<p>Whichever outcome happens, you will get back as many points as you placed on that outcome. You put 60 points on a six, 30 on a single, 5 on clean-bowled, and 5 on a dot ball. He hits a six, you get 60 points. He defends, you get 5 points. He gets run out, you get 0 points.</p>
<p>You play the next round, again with 100 points, and try your luck with new bets.</p>
<p>The Prediction Game is the game we play in life. Each event we experience is a new round where we need to place our bets (100 points). The points you bet above on each outcome represent your <em>probability estimates</em>. Putting 50 points on Dhoni-hitting-Six means you think it has 50% probability of happening.</p>
<p>Note that the general rule of Gambling holds - the casino always wins in the long run. You will never make more than a 100 points back in a round. Most often, you will lose a few points cos of your inaccurate predictions.</p>
<h1 id="your-prediction-score">Your Prediction Score</h1>
<p>Your score in each round is measured as a fraction of 1. Say you won 50 points, your score is 0.5.</p>
<p>Your overall score isn’t the <em>sum</em> of the points you won in each round. That would be too forgiving. You can do ok on most games and absolutely suck in a few games and still come out with a decent score.</p>
<p>Nope. Your Overall Score is the <em>product</em> of all your scores.</p>
<p>Intuitively, this is a measure of how much money you will be left with at the end of the night.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Money at end of night = Initial money * Prediction Score * Product of Payoffs</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Example of real bets: Say you start with $1000 and you bet proportionately to your point spread. There are three rounds and the casino gives you payoffs of 2x, 3x, and 2.5x in the respective rounds if you win.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First round</p>
<p>The outcome on which you put 80 points wins. So, you get $1000 * 0.80 * 2x = $1600 back.</p></li>
<li><p>Second round</p>
<p>The outcome on which you put 50 points wins. So, you get $1600 * 0.50 * 3x = $2400 back.</p></li>
<li><p>Third round</p>
<p>The outcome on which you put 75 points wins. So, you get $2400 * 0.75 * 2.5x = $4500 back.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your overall Prediction Score is 0.80 * 0.50 * 0.75 = 0.30. Product of payoffs = 2 * 3 * 2.5 = 15.</p>
<p>So, another way of calculating Money Left = $1000 * 0.30 * 15 = $4500</p>
<p>Look at the formula. The outcomes that will actually win (Dhoni hit a six, etc.) are out of your control. You can think of the winning outcomes as already decided. So the Product of Payoffs is already fixed. The initial money in hand is fixed too.</p>
<p>The only thing that determines how much money you’ll leave with is your Prediction Score.</p>
<p>[<strong>Advanced Note</strong>: The Payoffs here will also vary depending on how much money you decided to bet on each outcome. But, given a probability distribution, how much of your money you will (and should) bet on each outcome can be derived using Expected Utility calculations. So, that really is fixed. The only deciding factor is your probability distribution - your Prediction]</p>
<h1 id="dumbass-bet">Dumbass Bet</h1>
<p>Prediction Score is the product of individual scores.</p>
<p>This means - one zero and you’re out of the game.</p>
<p>Why is this so?</p>
<p>The short answer is: when you don’t bet any points on the winning outcome (i.e., you completely mis-predict), you lose everything you bet.</p>
<p>And, in general, you are playing with <em>all</em> the money you’ve got every moment of your life. Even the money in your bank vault is part of a bet - you’re betting that the Joker or someone else won’t go and rob that bank. It may be 99.99% safe (Or not. Remember the banking crisis?), but there is still the 0.01% possibility that your money will vanish. So, <em>all your money</em> is on the table.</p>
<p>Which means, if you bet 0 points on the winning outcome, you’re finished. Game Over.</p>
<p>Something like, not wearing a seat-belt going at 100kph on the highway. Small probability of crashing, true, but you bet pretty much nothing on that outcome. You didn’t slow down. You didn’t wear your seat-belt. You’re finished.</p>
<p>Or, putting all your money in one construction project, like in Sivaji: The Boss. If some government assholes interfere, and they will, it’s over. You put zero points on that outcome. You’re finished (unless you’re Superstar - in which case, you’ll become even more awesome. But that’s unlikely. I wouldn’t put more than 0.1 points on that outcome if I were you :P.).</p>
<p>Which is why Rational people will always bet a non-zero amount on each outcome, sometimes super-tiny bets of 0.0000001 or whatever. You absolutely <em>have</em> to spread it up, even if it is only to cover your ass in the worst-case scenario.</p>
<h1 id="what-does-probability-mean">What does “Probability” mean?</h1>
<p>What does it mean to say “Dhoni is gonna hit a six with 50% probability”? Is there some kind of weird coin-toss happening somewhere to decide whether Dhoni will hit a six or not? Nope. Reality is lawful and deterministic. By knowing the current state of the world, with enough computing power, you can predict exactly what’s gonna happen next.</p>
<p>Only one thing happens in reality. Reality is not confused about what’s gonna happen next. You are. That’s why <em>you</em> have to hedge your bets and use probability. If you knew for sure what would happen, you could just bet all your money on that outcome.</p>
<p>Confusion about the world is in your mind, not in reality. There are no probabilities in reality. Probability is a measure of <em>your</em> uncertainty about the world.</p>
<p>You want to get maximum Prediction Score (so that you can get maximum Money Left to Spend at the End of the Night). But putting all your points on one outcome means you will lose everything (see Dumbass Bet above). Which means you have to hedge. Those hedging bets represent your probability estimates of what is gonna happen next. That is all probability is - measure of your uncertainty about the world so that you can hedge your bets and get as much money as you can despite not knowing things for sure.</p>
<h1 id="the-most-important-thing-tm">The Most Important Thing (TM)</h1>
<p>What do we want in life? We want to maximize the amount of utility we get (happiness, achievements, whatever).</p>
<p>Cool. But that seems far away from the area of Truth-seeking, right?</p>
<p>No more. We saw above how your Prediction Score directly and <em>completely</em> determines how much utility you have at the end of the night.</p>
<p>The Truth is <em>all</em> that matters. The more you get it right, the more you will get what you want.</p>
<p>Truth-seeking is not some esoteric field like archaeology or geology that is only interesting to some weird, crazy people. We are not interested in the Truth here for some aesthetic benefits or divine pleasure. We are not devoted to the Truth for spiritual enlightenment.</p>
<p>We care about the Truth because that is what will get us to our goals. The name of the game is Maximize your Prediction Score. Do that and you will Maximize your Utility.</p>
<hr />
<p>Cool. So how do we do that? Well, simple. Just make sure you have the best bets (aka probability estimates) so that you get the maximum possible Prediction Score.</p>
<p>How do you do <em>that</em>?</p>
<p>Coming Soon.</p>

<li><p>Prediction = Betting Game</p></li>
<li><p>The Prediction Score derivation.</p>
<p>I hadn’t realized why it was so important when Eliezer explained it (as Bayesian Score). Prediction Score determines <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>Plus, the idea that you’re betting with everything. All the money is on the table.</p></li>

<p>Note: I took a couple of days off on account of hand rest. Three months of no typing - absolutely free of pain. Three posts later - pain starts again. Make your own deductions.</p>
<p>Will be cutting down on essay size (but hopefully not essay quality) from now on.</p>

<h1 id="simple-test">Simple Test</h1>
<p>Use only causal models when learning or solving problems. Do <em>not</em> use the alternative ways of thinking: intuition (“it was the butler!”), vague black-box hypotheses (examples?), or correlations (“obesity is associated with a risk of heart disease”).</p>
<p>So, notice when you <em>don’t</em> think causally, and then think causally instead.</p>
<p>This is when you’re solving problems. When learning, make sure you try to extract a causal model from the textbook or journal paper or whatever resource you’re studying. If you don’t have a causal model at the end, you haven’t really learned anything.</p>
<h1 id="chunks">Chunks</h1>
<p>Operationalize: Get variables from the resources. For example, in the SSC post on Toxoplasma, he’s talking about signalling and controversies and popularity and usefulness.</p>
<p>Extract: Get the causal model involving those variables. How does Scott connect usefulness, controversy, and popularity?</p>
<p>Learn: Get the evidence and formulate alternative hypotheses (causal models). Perhaps popularity is caused by other stuff.</p>
<p>Differing prediction: Look at the differing predictions between the models. Check some controversial messages that <em>didn’t</em> go viral.</p>
<p>Test: Look at the variable that differs. Virality above.</p>
<p>Anticipation-constraints: What else could be a direct cause? What else can cause virality?</p>
<h1 id="make-your-causal-models-usable">Make your causal models usable</h1>
<p>One problem with my causality practice so far: I’ve been analyzing the causal links in PG essays and Seligman chapters, but I haven’t set them up to be used elsewhere. They have literally no VoI. If I want to know something about “what to do before a startup”, I’ll read PG’s essay once again instead of referring to my causal model. In other words, my causal model isn’t reusable (or even usable).</p>
<p>Write them in a format where you can use them elsewhere. Store them in your memory on appropriate cues. Collect them in a place where you will come back. Otherwise, they have no value. Seligman’s chapter about panic attacks is pretty much useless to me. So, I didn’t bother trying to make my notes reusable.</p>
<p>In short, it was all use-and-throw work so far. Time to make something more lasting. For example, my notes on Seligman’s chapters or all my PG work so far or even Willpower, which is one of the most personally useful pieces of information I have. I didn’t <em>do</em> anything with those notes. If you want to practice learning, then actually do what you will actually do when you’re learning. Use your notes. For example, make causal models out of Eliezer’s sequences, PG’s essays, the Willpower book, Gamification, Boundaries, etc. Show that they have VoI. Design them so that you can actually use them in your life.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should write an essay on them. Remember, I’m going to have to release them sometime, in some format. What format is better than an essay?</p>
<h1 id="tell-me-what-to-do">Tell Me What To Do</h1>
<p>Organize your causal models (essays, notes, thoughts) by decisions. What is the upshot? What should I do in situation X?</p>
<p>This might be best served by modelling those variables involved in your decisions. For example, if you want to know whether to be mean or not as a startup founder, then find out what being mean causes.</p>
<h1 id="release-the-scientific-method">Release the scientific method</h1>
<p>Show how you can solve one simple problem from start to end (for <em>a</em> given decision). For example, should I do cardio for 20 minutes everyday or 40 minutes everyday? What is the tradeoff? Should I force myself to eat fewer calories? Should I try to work (and think and practice) for 8 hours everyday or just 5 or even less? Should I buy a new set of calipers? Should I focus on causal thinking or memory? Should I try to take on one big project (like photography or maybe something else) or do lots of smaller things like PG essays and textbooks?</p>
<p>Note: As predicted by my good friend Mr. Exemplar, I get a flood of ideas once I decide to focus on a clear, concrete example (“one decision like cardio for 20 minutes vs 40”) instead of the vague “decisions”.</p>
<h1 id="practical-problems">Practical Problems</h1>
<p>One skill in solving problems using causal thinking is backward inference. For example, the general wisdom is that if you have to read a book twice, you didn’t do a good job the first time around. They say reading a book well causes you to understand it so well that you won’t have any questions left needing an answer.</p>
<p>You should be able to do this everywhere. Like, feeling resentful towards someone is evidence that you have let them violate your boundaries. Another example: if you’re stuck on a problem, you must not have any exemplars in your mind to trigger on (or you must not be paying attention to the right cues).</p>
<p>I suspect that backward inference is harder than forward inference. The question “what will happen if your boundaries are violated?” is easy to answer - you will feel resentful towards the violator. But what if you’re feeling resentful right now? It feels hard to go back to the cause.</p>
<p>Further, I suspect that this is because, in our mind, we encode causal models in the forward direction, but fail to do so in the backward direction. “Boundary violation” causes “resentment” is straightforward - it’s what you do when you study the area. But to go from “resentment” to “boundary violation” takes some doing. You have to encode it explicitly.</p>
<p>So, for every variable, you must know its direct causes. Maybe that’s too general. Maybe you should know what happens for every possible outcome of that variable - if you’re feeling relaxed and in control, you must not have any boundary violations; if you’re feeling resentful, you must have boundary violations.</p>

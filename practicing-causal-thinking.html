<h1 id="simple-test">Simple Test</h1>
<p>Use only causal models when learning or solving problems. Do <em>not</em> use the alternative ways of thinking: intuition (“it was the butler!”), vague black-box hypotheses (examples?), or correlations (“obesity is associated with a risk of heart disease”).</p>
<p>So, notice when you <em>don’t</em> think causally, and then think causally instead.</p>
<p>This is when you’re solving problems. When learning, make sure you try to extract a causal model from the textbook or journal paper or whatever resource you’re studying. If you don’t have a causal model at the end, you haven’t really learned anything.</p>
<h1 id="chunks">Chunks</h1>
<p>Operationalize: Get variables from the resources. For example, in the SSC post on Toxoplasma, he’s talking about signalling and controversies and popularity and usefulness.</p>
<p>Extract: Get the causal model involving those variables. How does Scott connect usefulness, controversy, and popularity?</p>
<p>Learn: Get the evidence and formulate alternative hypotheses (causal models). Perhaps popularity is caused by other stuff.</p>
<p>Differing prediction: Look at the differing predictions between the models. Check some controversial messages that <em>didn’t</em> go viral.</p>
<p>Test: Look at the variable that differs. Virality above.</p>
<p>Anticipation-constraints: What else could be a direct cause? What else can cause virality?</p>
<h1 id="make-your-causal-models-usable">Make your causal models usable</h1>
<p>One problem with my causality practice so far: I’ve been analyzing the causal links in PG essays and Seligman chapters, but I haven’t set them up to be used elsewhere. They have literally no VoI. If I want to know something about “what to do before a startup”, I’ll read PG’s essay once again instead of referring to my causal model. In other words, my causal model isn’t reusable (or even usable).</p>
<p>Write them in a format where you can use them elsewhere. Store them in your memory on appropriate cues. Collect them in a place where you will come back. Otherwise, they have no value. Seligman’s chapter about panic attacks is pretty much useless to me. So, I didn’t bother trying to make my notes reusable.</p>
<p>In short, it was all use-and-throw work so far. Time to make something more lasting. For example, my notes on Seligman’s chapters or all my PG work so far or even Willpower, which is one of the most personally useful pieces of information I have. I didn’t <em>do</em> anything with those notes. If you want to practice learning, then actually do what you will actually do when you’re learning. Use your notes. For example, make causal models out of Eliezer’s sequences, PG’s essays, the Willpower book, Gamification, Boundaries, etc. Show that they have VoI. Design them so that you can actually use them in your life.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should write an essay on them. Remember, I’m going to have to release them sometime, in some format. What format is better than an essay?</p>
<h1 id="tell-me-what-to-do">Tell Me What To Do</h1>
<p>Organize your causal models (essays, notes, thoughts) by decisions. What is the upshot? What should I do in situation X?</p>

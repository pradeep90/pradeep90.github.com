<h1 id="identity">Identity</h1>
<p>Your identity is what you respect. If your identity is to be lean and fit, you will feel great when you have a six-pack and feel awful when you put on a belly. Similarly, you will respect those who exercise regularly and keep themselves lean, and you will demean those who stuff their face with pizza and beer and then ask why they look pregnant all of a sudden (despite being men).</p>
<p>Our identity may contain many things that we respect, such as fitness, ability to sing, wealth, public-speaking skills, or even just having a nice-looking car. Falling down in any of those respects, perhaps by going into debt or getting tongue-tied on stage, will make you feel like a low-life loser.</p>
<p>Fighting your identity is tough. If you care deeply about fitness but have a potbelly and can’t do even a single pullup, you’re going to be depressed. Guaranteed.</p>
<p>So, we can’t control our actions directly. We will do whatever is part of our identity. You may want to “do good things and not care about what others say” how much ever you want, but you will still end up feeling butthurt all day when someone mocks your speech or ridiculous your taste in films if speaking well and having idiots think well of you is currently a big part of your identity. Whether we like it or not, this is how the human mind seems to be designed. Doing certain things makes us feel good and doing their opposite makes us feel bad.</p>
<p>Therefore, to do what we care about we must shape our identity appropriately. Our identity is basically our steering wheel on the road of life.</p>
<p>That brings us to the million-dollar question: how to shape our identity?</p>
<p>Hypothesis: Identity = bunch of rules about respect.</p>
<p>TODO: Talk about opportunity costs and ignoring other worthy aspects of life. Your supply of respect is limited. Spend it carefully.</p>
<p>What will happen if you start respecting anybody and everybody?</p>
<p>Explain how respect pays out in skill and thus domain-specific gains and finally utilons.</p>

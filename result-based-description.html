<h1 id="jumping-to-conclusions">Jumping to Conclusions</h1>
<p>Suppose your friend tells you he’s on a weight-loss program. What do you think will happen in three months if he keeps on the weight-loss program? Will he lose weight?</p>
<p>If you’re like me, you’re thinking, “Of course. He is on a weight-loss program, isn’t he? So, ipso facto, he will lose weight.”</p>
<p>Does there seem to be anything fishy about that chain of reasoning?</p>
<p>We usually describe the current features of a thing and predict something about the future. For example, we might say “I’m running for half an hour each day” and predict that we will lose a certain number of pounds by the end of the month. But your friend above skipped the description and talked about the prediction as if it were visible right now: “I’m on a weight-loss program”.</p>
<p>You weren’t told the features of the activity (running for half an hour) or even a name (CrossFit program). If you had been told either, you could have judged it based on your past knowledge of those features or names. Running regularly does help you lose weight and so does CrossFit. But, here, you were told just the prediction itself. This means you can’t predict anything for sure. If his program involves running, he will lose weight; if it involves eating large cheese pizzas, he won’t. You don’t know which it is.</p>
<p>Yet, it sounded convincing!</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: If you are given an adjective that describes a future event and are not given any currently-visible features, then you’re likely to jump to the conclusion that that future event will occur.</p>
<p>This means that if you accept such a result-based description, like “weight-loss program”, you will assume that the thing will produce the result when it may actually not.</p>
<p>A more serious example is when someone mentions a drug-prevention program. We automatically think that it will prevent illegal drugs from being bought and sold. But that depends on what measures the program actually adopts. Running ads saying “Don’t do drugs!” may not achieve much, whereas inspecting trucks at border checkpoints may. To judge whether the program will be successful, you have to inspect its actual features. But “drug-prevention program” sounded convincing, right? Notice how the definition of the adjective “drug-prevention” depends on future events - it says that drugs will be prevented in the future. Now, since you can’t look into the future and tell whether drugs will be prevented, you shouldn’t accept such an adjective. And since you’re not told anything else about the program, you really can’t say anything either way. And yet it sounds so convincing!</p>
<p>Similarly, take environment-protection laws. Don’t you feel like they will protect the environment? After all, it’s right there in the name. Contrast that to saying “a law that increases the tax on fossil fuels”. Now this may or may not protect the environment in terms of air pollution, but at least you don’t jump to that conclusion right away.</p>
<p>This means that the person who chooses the adjective can mislead you (and himself) in the direction he desires by describing the thing in terms of the result and by omitting any features. Suppose someone tells you this is an earthquake-resistant building. Do you believe that it will withstand earthquakes better than ordinary buildings? I do. He described the thing solely in terms of the result. But it still sounded convincing, right? Contrast that to “this building is made out of steel-reinforced concrete”. Now, you have one feature of the building. If you had to predict whether it would withstand earthquakes better than ordinary buildings, you would lean towards yes because reinforced concrete has worked in the past. But you wouldn’t always jump to the conclusion that it was “earthquake-resistant”. If I said “this building is made out of green-colored brick”, you would be skeptical about its ability to withstand earthquakes better because you haven’t heard anything about brick color being relevant.</p>
<p>The above illusion is compounded by the fact that you won’t get feedback from others about your mistaken ideas if you use result-based descriptions. Suppose your weight-loss friend assumed that using a telemarketed ab machine will help him get abs (it’s right there in the name, I tell you!). Even then, he wouldn’t have been lost if he had told you his concrete plan. You would have corrected his belief as soon as you stopped laughing at him. But since he told you that he’s using a weight-loss program, you couldn’t really correct him. He might go on behaving as if that silly “ab machine” is going to get him six-pack abs by summer.</p>
<p>Why do we even accept descriptions that have nothing except a description about the future?</p>
<p>For one, it matters that no features are described. If I said that I was drinking lemonade, you wouldn’t really predict that I would lose weight. You would ask me what evidence I have for lemonade causing weight-loss. But what if I said I was having a weight-loss drink? You might be less skeptical as long as you didn’t look at my glass. Who knows; maybe there are drinks out there that cause weight-loss.</p>
<p>Another relevant factor is <del>the speaker’s credibility</del> how often we think the speaker sees the underlying features along with the eventual result. We accept an expert’s result-based description because we trust that he knows the features that lead to the result and is just omitting them when talking to a layman. When a doctor says that these are “sleeping pills”, we are more likely to accept it than when a school boy does - the doctor knows that the pills contain benzodiazepine, which usually works. When a politician calls something “drug-prevention program”, we are more likely to accept it than when a housewife says it - the politician knows that border-checks (or whatever) have worked in the past. However, this might be misleading when the expert is dealing with something novel, such as a brand-new pill formula or a brand-new approach to drug regulations, since he is unlikely to have seen the result of those features (or may not care very much about deceiving the voters).</p>
<p>So, we should avoid describing something only in terms of the result and should describe it using features instead. And if anyone tries to bias our prediction by sneaking in an adjective from the future, we should stop and ask for the features.</p>
<h1 id="examples-of-adjective-from-the-future">Examples of Adjective from the Future</h1>
<p>Here’s a laundry list of result-based descriptions that I collected from news reports and books as I was testing the above hypothesis.</p>
<hr />
<p>Rehabilitation program – Don’t you feel like the drug addict is going to get better after going to the rehab program? It’s right there in the name! Notice that there are no features mentioned, just a description of the future as though it were the present. Contrast that to “not having access to drugs for two weeks, listening to lectures, and talking about your experiences”. This doesn’t make us jump to the conclusion that the addict will get better. We might even be skeptical about the power of lectures to fight off the temptation of drugs. Also note that you won’t get feedback from others if you kept saying “he’s being sent to a rehab program” as opposed to “he’s going to listen to lectures for two weeks”. (I’m not saying all rehab programs are only about lectures. Just wanted to make the point that we don’t ask for features when someone talks only in terms of results.)</p>
<p>Peace process. – Feels like it is going to lead to peace. No features; only desired results. Contrast that to “shaking hands and signing agreements”. We may or may not accept that that will prevent future wars. But in the former case, we would be insulated from feedback because we keep talking about the “peace process” instead of the “hand-shaking and agreement-signing”.</p>
<p>Brain emulation (or brain-emulating software). – We jump to the conclusion that it will behave like a human brain. It’s a brain emulation. What are its features, though? Which tests and formal proofs does it satisfy? Contrast that to saying that you have a program that has driven a car like a human does. That’s pretty cool, but we still won’t buy that it can do general-purpose things like write programs or compose songs. (Not saying machines can’t do that. Just saying that the actual features make us a lot more skeptical than the adjective.)</p>
<p>Healthy morning drink – No features. Not even the “morning” part is a description of a feature of the object. It just talks about the time when people will drink it. Contrast to: drink containing 15g of protein and other stuff, which may or may not lead to more “health”.</p>
<p>Decisive strategic advantage – Sounds good. Decisive strategic advantage, for the win! Again, this is defined fully in terms of future events. No features. No feedback from others if you go around saying that you’ve got a “decisive strategic advantage”. Contrast that to saying that you have the kinds of weapons that decided the last war (instead of “decisive”) and you have more weapons than the enemy (instead of “advantage”). Now, this may or may not win this war, but at least you don’t jump to any conclusions.</p>
<p>Sufficiently well-funded – It’s going to be sufficient. It says so right in the name! No features; only future results. Contrast that to: $35 million dollar budget. All of a sudden, not fully sure if that will be sufficient or not. But you’re more open to feedback than in the previous case, where people will just assume it will work.</p>
<p>Dangerous driving – No features; no feedback; only the future result - danger. Contrast that to: one-handed driving, texting while driving, or overtaking by switching lanes and coming close to the other vehicles.</p>
<p>Unprepared military – It’s unprepared. End of story. No features; only future results. Lack of feedback from others if you keep talking about the other country’s military as unprepared. Contrast that to “lack of heat-seeking missiles”. That may or may not be enough to make you lose.</p>
<p>Momentous decision – I feel like it’s going to have great impact in the future. Again, no features. Contrast that to “choosing to bat first after winning the toss”. Now, I’m not so sure. Whatever happens, they have the bowlers to manage it. Plus, this is not an elimination match.</p>
<p>National security bill – It’s going to increase national security. Same old - no features; only future result. Lack of feedback from others. Contrast that to “increasing the number of tanks in the army”.</p>
<p>Infallible technique – It’s not going to fail. Contrast that to “yorker in the death overs”. Not so confident anymore, given that people know how to Dil-scoop yorkers.</p>
<p>Very bad news for our country – What can I say? It must be very bad news for our country. Contrast that to “the value of the currency just went down by 29%”.</p>
<p>Measures to control risk in the economy – I jump to the conclusion that those measures are going to control risk. No features again; only future result. Contrast that to “diversify the portfolio and lower federal interest rates”.</p>
<p>Cost-cutting measures.</p>
<p>Optimization power. – No features. I just feel like that this thing is going to optimize shit. It’s an optimization power. Contrast that to “1 GHz of processing power”. Ok. It may optimize stuff or it may not; depends on the algorithm it’s running.</p>
<p>Intelligent machine – No features; just future results. Of course it’s going to do intelligent stuff. Contrast that to “the A* algorithm”.</p>
<p>Health-care plan – Yeah, people’s health is going to be cared for. No features; only future result; insulated from feedback if you say “health-care plan” instead of “pay 90% of the costs of prescriptions and surgeries”. The latter may not make you as confident that people’s health is going to be cared for.</p>
<p>Superintelligence. – Do I even need to say anything? It’s intelligence that is super. No features.</p>
<p>Seed AI (or self-improving AI). – Feels like the AI will recursively self-improve in the future. But it doesn’t describe anything about the program.</p>
<p>Important elections – This talks about future consequences of the elections, but not the current issues. Contrast that to “the winner of the elections has to negotiate with an international trade organization regarding billions of dollars”.</p>
<p>Frivolous lawsuit – No features; only talks about the future result (that it won’t lead to any favorable judgment). I’m not saying lawyers don’t know what <del>frivolous lawsuits</del> lawsuits that usually end up getting thrown out look like. But we don’t. And we’re inclined to accept the prediction about the future because of the suggestive label. What if they are wrong about this particular judge?</p>
<p>Do-gooder – We feel like good will be done. No features; only the future result. Even the dictionary definition is result-based: “someone devoted to the promotion of human welfare and to social reforms” (WordNet). No features that you can observe in the present! Only future results. Contrast that to “someone who gives alms to beggars”. Now, that may or may not lead to good things. You’re no longer as gullible as in the previous descriptions.</p>
<p>Try harder to improve – You expect that this person will improve. No features. Contrast that to “spend more time solving practice problems”. This may or may not actually improve your performance.</p>
<p>Recidivism-reduction classes for ex-convicts (i.e., making sure they don’t go back to jail after getting out) – Again, we feel like these classes will make them less likely to go back in. The classes reduce recidivism, after all. No features mentioned; description in terms of the future result (recidivism reduction); insulated from feedback. Contrast that to “lectures and reading books and stuff”. We might be much more skeptical.</p>
<p>A Sudoku-solving program – It will solve Sudoku puzzles. No features mentioned; only future results. Lack of feedback if you go around saying you’ve written a “Sudoku-solving program”. Contrast to “program that solved easy, medium, and hard puzzles and seemed to satisfy my informal theorems about solving such puzzles.”</p>
<p>Perfectly-loyal sub-modules – Those sub-modules will work their sub-asses off without betraying you. They’re perfectly-loyal. Lack of skepticism because of the lack of features; only future results. Contrast that to: sub-modules about whom you have proved theorems saying that they won’t reveal data without the password.</p>
<p>Dynamics that lead to snowball effects – Of course it will lead to snowball effects. No features to make us skeptical. Only future results.</p>
<p>No capacity to harm others – Will not harm others. Contrast that to “doesn’t have a knife”. Not so sure he won’t harm others. What if he uses some other weapon?</p>
<p>Attacking batsman – I feel like he is, for sure, going to attack in the future. But I can see no other features; he’s described in terms of the future result; and you are insulated from feedback if you call him that. Contrast that to “batsman with a 125 strike rate”. Now, I don’t know for sure. Many people have that in T20 matches. Plus, he may have only batted in a few innings.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here are some assorted terms, all of which talk about future results, completely omit current features, and make us jump to the desired conclusion:</p>
<p>Permanent control vs words on paper saying permanent control.</p>
<p>Intelligence enhancement vs increase in speed or more memory.</p>
<p>Effective deterrent vs equal-sized military.</p>
<p>International control vs signed treaty that says they’ll attack you if you break the rules.</p>
<p>Highly-secure facility vs several guards that scan all baggage. That may or may not reduce the number of security breaches.</p>
<p>Effective monitoring.</p>

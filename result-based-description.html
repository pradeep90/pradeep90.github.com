<h1 id="jumping-to-conclusions">Jumping to Conclusions</h1>
<p>Suppose your friend tells you he’s on a weight-loss program. What do you think will happen in three months if he keeps on the weight-loss program? Will he lose weight?</p>
<p>If you’re like me, you’re thinking, “Of course. He is on a weight-loss program, isn’t he? So, ipso facto, he will lose weight.”</p>
<p>Does there seem to be anything fishy about that chain of reasoning?</p>
<p>We usually describe the current features of a thing and predict something about the future. For example, we might say “I’m running for half an hour each day” and predict that we will lose a certain number of pounds by the end of the month. But your friend above skipped the description and talked about the prediction as if it were visible right now: “I’m on a weight-loss program”.</p>
<p>You weren’t told the features of the activity (running for half an hour) or even a name (CrossFit program). If you had been told either, you could have judged it based on your past knowledge of those features or names. Running regularly does help you lose weight and so does CrossFit. But, here, you were told just the prediction itself. This means you can’t predict anything for sure. If his program involves running, he will lose weight; if it involves eating large cheese pizzas, he won’t. You don’t know which it is.</p>
<p>Yet, it sounded convincing! Even if you objected by saying that your friend probably won’t stick to the exercise regimen, you probably bought into the premise, like me, that the program <em>was</em> a weight-loss program.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: If you are given an adjective that describes a future event and are not given any currently-visible features, then you’re likely to jump to the conclusion that that future event will occur.</p>
<p>However, if you can see some features, you are more likely to be skeptical.</p>
<p>This means that if you hear a result-based description, like “weight-loss program”, you will assume that the thing will produce the result when it may actually not. Not so much when you hear about a “steam room that helps you lose fat”. You haven’t really heard about the feature (steam) making people lose weight.</p>
<p>A more serious example is when someone mentions a drug-prevention program. We automatically think that it will prevent illegal drugs from being bought and sold. But that depends on what measures the program actually adopts. Running ads saying “Don’t do drugs!” may not achieve much, whereas inspecting trucks at border checkpoints may. To judge whether the program will be successful, you have to inspect its actual features. But “drug-prevention program” sounded convincing, right? Notice how the adjective “drug-prevention” describes a future event - it says that drugs will be prevented in the future. Now, since you can’t look into the future and tell whether drugs were in fact prevented, you shouldn’t accept such an adjective. And since you’re not told anything else about the program, you really can’t say anything either way. And yet it sounds so convincing!</p>
<p>Similarly, take environment-protection laws. Don’t you feel like they will protect the environment? After all, it’s right there in the name. Contrast that to saying “a law that increases the tax on fossil fuels”. Now this may or may not protect the environment in terms of air pollution, but at least you don’t jump to that conclusion right away.</p>
<p>This means that the person who chooses the adjective can mislead you (and himself) in the direction he desires by describing the thing in terms of the result and by omitting any features.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Suppose someone tells you this is an earthquake-resistant building. Do you believe that it will withstand earthquakes better than ordinary buildings? I do. He may have described the thing solely in terms of the result, but it still sounded convincing, right? Contrast that to “this building is made out of steel-reinforced concrete”. Now, you have one feature of the building. If you had to predict whether it would withstand earthquakes better than ordinary buildings, you would lean towards yes because reinforced concrete has worked in the past. But you wouldn’t always jump to the conclusion that it was “earthquake-resistant”. If I said “this building is made out of green-colored brick”, you would be skeptical about its ability to withstand earthquakes better because you haven’t heard anything about brick color being relevant.</p>
<p>The above illusion is compounded by the fact that you won’t get feedback from others about your mistaken ideas if you use result-based descriptions. Suppose your weight-loss friend assumed that using a telemarketed ab machine will help him get abs (it’s right there in the name, I tell you!). Even then, he wouldn’t have been lost if he had told you his concrete plan. You would have corrected his belief as soon as you stopped laughing at him. But since he told you that he’s using a weight-loss program, you couldn’t really correct him. He might go on behaving as if that silly “ab machine” is going to get him six-pack abs by summer.</p>
<p>Why do we even accept descriptions that have nothing except a description about the future?</p>
<p>For one, it matters that no features are described. If I said that I was drinking lemonade, you wouldn’t really predict that I would lose weight. You would ask me what evidence I have for lemonade causing weight-loss. But what if I said I was having a weight-loss drink? You might be less skeptical as long as you didn’t look at my glass. Who knows; maybe there are drinks out there that cause weight-loss.</p>
<p>Another relevant factor is <del>the speaker’s credibility</del> how often we think the speaker sees the underlying features along with the eventual result. We accept an expert’s result-based description because we trust that he knows the features that lead to the result and is just omitting them when talking to a layman. When a doctor says that these are “sleeping pills”, we are more likely to accept it than when a school boy does - the doctor knows that the pills contain benzodiazepine, which usually works. When a politician calls something a “drug-prevention program”, we are more likely to accept it than when a housewife says it - the politician knows that border-checks (or whatever) have worked in the past. However, this might be misleading when the expert is dealing with something novel, such as a brand-new pill formula or a brand-new approach to drug regulations, since he is unlikely to have seen the result of those features (or may not care very much about deceiving the voters).</p>
<p>Finally, such descriptions might be fine when talking about the past. Saying that “I went on a weight-loss program and lost 50 pounds” is a bit redundant, but harmless. You actually observe the result there, so you can decide based on the result how skeptical to be. You won’t blindly jump to the conclusion that it will work as when someone says “I’m on a weight-loss program right now”.</p>
<p>So, we should avoid describing something only in terms of the result and should describe it using features instead. And if anyone tries to bias our prediction by sneaking in an adjective from the future, we should stop and ask for the features.</p>
<h1 id="examples-of-adjectives-from-the-future">Examples of Adjectives from the Future</h1>
<p>Here’s a list of result-based descriptions that I collected from news reports and books as I was testing the above hypothesis. All of them talk about future results, completely omit current features, and seem to make us jump to the desired conclusion.</p>
<hr />
<p>Rehabilitation program – Don’t you feel like the drug addict is going to get better after going to the rehab program? It’s right there in the name! Notice that there are no features mentioned, just a description of the future as though it were the present. Contrast that to “not having access to drugs for two weeks, listening to lectures, and talking about your experiences”. This doesn’t make us jump to the conclusion that the addict will get better. We might even be skeptical about the power of lectures to fight off the temptation of drugs. Also note that you won’t get feedback from others if you kept saying “he’s being sent to a rehab program” as opposed to “he’s going to listen to lectures for two weeks”. (I’m not saying all rehab programs are only about lectures. Just wanted to make the point that we don’t ask for features when someone talks only in terms of results.) For a real-world contrast, think of “the 12-step program”. It too tries to overcome addiction, but it is described in terms of the features (12 steps), not the desired result (overcoming addiction). In fact, it sounds like work, which it probably is. A rehabilitation program doesn’t sound like that.</p>
<p>Peace process – Feels like it is going to lead to peace. No features; only desired results. Contrast that to “shaking hands and signing agreements”. We may or may not accept that that will prevent future wars. But in the former case, we would be insulated from feedback because we keep talking about the “peace process” instead of the “hand-shaking and agreement-signing”. Wait. Aren’t there people who distrust the peace process and talk about its possible failure? I suspect that they do so after mentioning features of the process. They might say that this dictator has reneged on his promises in the past and thus should not be trusted right now. It would sound ludicrous if they expressed skepticism without any features. People would ask, “What do you mean this peace process may not bring about peace? It’s a peace process.”</p>
<p>Brain emulation (or brain-emulating software) – We jump to the conclusion that it will behave like a human brain. It’s a brain emulation. What are its features, though? Which tests and formal proofs does it satisfy? Contrast that to saying that you have a program that has driven a car like a human does. That’s pretty cool, but we still won’t buy that it can do general-purpose things like write programs or compose songs. (Not saying machines can’t do that. Just saying that the actual features make us a lot more skeptical than the adjective.)</p>
<p>Unprepared military – It’s unprepared. End of story. No features; only future results. Lack of feedback from others if you keep talking about the other country’s military as unprepared. Contrast that to “lack of heat-seeking missiles”. That may or may not be enough to make you lose.</p>
<p>Cost-cutting measures – Need I say anything? Of course it’s going to cut costs.</p>
<p>National security bill – It’s going to increase national security. Same old - no features; only future result. Lack of feedback from others. Contrast that to “increasing the number of tanks in the army”.</p>
<p>Infallible technique – It’s not going to fail. Contrast that to “yorker in the death overs”. Not so confident anymore, given that people know how to Dil-scoop yorkers.</p>
<p>Sufficiently well-funded – It’s going to be sufficient. It says so right in the name! No features; only future results. Contrast that to: $35 million dollar budget. All of a sudden, not fully sure if that will be sufficient or not. But you’re more open to feedback than in the previous case, where people will just assume it will work.</p>
<p>Recidivism-reduction classes for ex-convicts (i.e., making sure they don’t go back to jail after getting out) – Again, we feel like these classes will make them less likely to go back in. The classes reduce recidivism, after all. No features mentioned; description in terms of the future result (recidivism reduction); insulated from feedback. Contrast that to “lectures and reading books and stuff”. We might be much more skeptical.</p>
<p>A Sudoku-solving program – It will solve Sudoku puzzles. No features mentioned; only future results. Lack of feedback if you go around saying you’ve written a “Sudoku-solving program”. Contrast to “program that solved easy, medium, and hard puzzles and seemed to satisfy my informal theorems about solving such puzzles.”</p>
<p>Healthy morning drink – No features. Even the “morning” part is not a description of a feature of the object. It just talks about the time when people will drink it. Contrast to: drink containing 15g of protein and other stuff, which may or may not lead to more “health”.</p>
<p>Optimization power – No features; just described in terms of the future results. I just feel like that this thing is going to optimize stuff. It’s an optimization power! Contrast that to “processor running at 1 GHz”. Ok. It may optimize stuff or it may not; depends on the algorithm it’s running.</p>
<p>Decisive strategic advantage – Sounds good. Decisive strategic advantage, for the win! Again, this is defined fully in terms of future events. No features. No feedback from others if you go around saying that you’ve got a “decisive strategic advantage”. Contrast that to saying that you have the kinds of weapons that decided the last war (instead of “decisive”) and you have more weapons than the enemy (instead of “advantage”). Now, this may or may not win this war, but at least you don’t jump to any conclusions.</p>
<p>Do-gooder – We feel like good will be done. No features; only the future result. Even the dictionary definition is result-based: “Someone devoted to the promotion of human welfare and to social reforms” (WordNet). No features that you can observe in the present! Only future results. Contrast that to “someone who gives alms to beggars”. Now, that may or may not lead to good things. You’re no longer as gullible as in the previous descriptions.</p>

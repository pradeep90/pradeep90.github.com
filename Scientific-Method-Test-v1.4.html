<h1 id="scientific-method-v1.4">Scientific Method v1.4</h1>
<p>Let’s continue using my v1.0 algorithm: Look at each paragraph and get the causal link.</p>
<p>At each step, ask if it is a correlation or a cause. In the first pass, identify the correlations. Next, ensure that each part of your correlation is a variable. Operationalize, in other words. Then, investigate causes. Use time and space to figure out the direction of causality. Finally, for every top-level variable, ask what its cause is.</p>
<p>For the causal links you posit, ask how the cause leads to the effect.</p>
<p>Key change: Come up with alternative models that satisfy the evidence so far.</p>
<p>Mission: Use this on one PG essay.</p>
<p>Time: 30 minutes</p>
<p>(Note: A -&gt; B stands for “A causes B”)</p>
<h1 id="organic-startup-ideas-by-pg">Organic Startup Ideas by PG</h1>
<h2 id="raw-correlations">Raw correlations</h2>
<p>The most successful startups seem to be closer to the Apple type than the Viaweb type. P(closer to Apple type than the Viaweb type | successful) is high. So what? We care about P(success | Apple type) not the other way around. So, that’s an alternative hypothesis: there could just be a lot more Apple-type startups with perhaps even a smaller likelihood of success than for Viaweb-types.</p>
<p>Correlation between experience and predicting what other people will want. (Why?) Experience comes before predicting what other people want, so predicting what other people will want can’t cause experience. Only possible models could be of experience causing accurate predictions about what others want, and something else causing both.</p>
<p>Correlation between standing outside of yourself and seeing brokenness, and also between getting used to something and not seeing brokenness. Getting used to something happens before not seeing brokenness? Maybe it goes both ways; if you see brokenness (maybe due to someone pointing it out), then you would “stand outside of yourself”, and if you stand outside of yourself, you would see brokenness more easily.</p>
<p>Correlation between organic startup ideas and whether they seem like startup ideas at first, and between whether they seem like startup ideas and whether you overlook them. Ideas seem (or don’t seem) like startup ideas before you overlook them, so the latter can’t cause the former. Similarly, organic startup ideas exist before they seem like startup ideas or not, so seeming like a startup idea can’t cause an organic startup idea to exist.</p>
<p>Correlation between fixing things that seem broken (regardless of the seeming importance of the problem) and making something of value to a lot of people (demand for your product). It could be that if you make something of value to a lot of people, you’re fixing something that seems broken. Not sure creating something valuable is a cause or an effect.</p>
<p>Correlation between people dismissing it as a toy, and them overlooking it.</p>
<p>Correlation between being at the forefront of technology and discovering valuable types of fixable brokenness, and thus having organic ideas,</p>
<p>Correlation between value and an unmet need that is just becoming fixable, and also between knowing where the unmet need is and rarity.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>Interventions can help you figure out the direction of causality. If A and B are correlated, manipulate A to see if B changes. Do it the other way around too - maybe they’re in a loop.</p>
<p>Make sure to create solid, measurable variables. “People will overlook that idea” is not good enough as a variable. Go for “% of people who pursue that idea after hearing it”.</p>

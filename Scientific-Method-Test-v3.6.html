<h1 id="scientific-method-v3.6">Scientific Method v3.6</h1>
<p>Here’s my v3.0 algorithm: Collect evidence, come up with small alternative models, and combine those into big models.</p>
<p>Mission: Collect 10 pieces of evidence.</p>
<p>Resource: The Will Power Instinct, by Kelly McGonigal</p>
<h1 id="chapter-six-what-the-hell">Chapter Six: What The Hell</h1>
<p>Whether you give in to willpower challenges depends on how guilty you feel.</p>
<p>Key variables: how guilty you feel, whether you give in</p>
<h1 id="evidence">Evidence</h1>
<p>Correlation: Most commonly used strategies to relieve stress are those that activate the brain’s reward system. But, they are also rated as highly ineffective.</p>
<p>Correlation: Only reliable change from eating is an increase in guilt.</p>
<p>Interventions: When smokers imagine a trip to the dentist, they feel heavy cravings for cigarettes. Binge-eaters and public speech -&gt; crave high-fat, sugary food.</p>
<p>Correlation: real-world stress increases risk of relapse among addicts.</p>
<p>Hypothesis from neuroscience: stress shifts the brain into a reward-seeking state.</p>
<p>Stress hormones also increase the excitability of dopamine neurons. Any temptations you run into will be even more tempting.</p>
<p>Correlation: women worried about their finances shop to cope with their anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>Interventions: most effective stress-relievers - exercising, meditating, etc. least effective - shopping, eating, playing video games, etc. Difference - instead of going for the promise of reward, go for things that boost mood-enhancing brain chemicals like serotonin and GABA, as well as feel-good hormone oxytocin. They also shut down the brain’s stress response and induce the relaxation response.</p>
<p>Intervention: being reminded of our mortality makes us susceptible to all sorts of temptations (presumably because we look for hope and security in the things that promise reward and relief).</p>
<p>Question: How is this different from the hypothesis that being reminded of our mortality trigger stress which makes us seek the promise of relief?</p>
<p>Intervention: shoppers asked to think about their own death -&gt; longer shopping lists, more willing to spend on comfort food, and eat more chocolates and cookies.</p>
<p>Correlation: reports of death on the news -&gt; respond more positively to status goods (because they bolster our self-image and make us feel powerful)</p>
<p>Intervention: watch death scene vs nature documentary -&gt; pay 3x as much for things they didn’t want</p>
<p>Intervention: cigarette pack warnings trigger stress and fear -&gt; more smoking</p>
<p>Correlation: Those who drank more than they intended the previous night -&gt; felt worse in the morning. But, the worse the person felt, the more they drank that night and the night after.</p>
<p>Correlation: many dieters felt so bad about any lapse, that they felt as if their whole diet was blown. Then, what the hell, …</p>
<p>Intervention: make dieters think they’ve gained five pounds -&gt; depressed, guilty, disappointed with themselves -&gt; turned to food</p>
<p>Correlation: What the hell effect (failure -&gt; guilt) in smokers, alcoholics, shoppers, child molesters.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: cycle because give in -&gt; guilt -&gt; seek promise of relief (which intensifies promise of reward) -&gt; give in</p>

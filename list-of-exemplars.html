<h1 id="aim">Aim</h1>
<p>Come up with three exemplars for each concept so that I have concrete cues on which to recall them, instead of some abstract labels I can’t apply.</p>
<p>Why do we need exemplars? So that we can learn to categorize an abstract concept from concrete situations, instead of just working with unproductive, floating labels like “neoliberalism” or “opprobrium”.</p>
<p>Also, list the counter-examples for that category, i.e., exemplars for the alternative values. Like the way “Ubuntu” is an alternative to “Windows” for the variable of closed-source vs open-source operating systems. This way I can categorize every possible value for that variable.</p>
<p>In fact, specify the diagnostic cues for each category. Like for mysterious concepts: the diagnostic cue is whether you have a diagnostic cue (example: elan vital vs not, better performance vs not).</p>
<p>Whenever I need to use or explain a concept, I should refer to its exemplars here. That way I’ll keep this list current and usable. Ditto for when I have a new idea about a concept - I can test it out on these exemplars.</p>
<h1 id="concepts">Concepts</h1>
<p><strong>Causal models</strong>: a = F/m. depression &lt;- rumination about pessimistic explanations vs not. willpower &lt;- energy available in your brain for self-control, your self-control habits.</p>
<p>What are not causal models? Prose explanations are not explicitly causal models. “This could explain the disconnect over cubicles. Maybe the people in charge of facilities, not having any concentration to shatter, have no idea that working in a cubicle feels to a hacker like having one’s brain in a blender.” (PG, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html">Great Hackers</a>) Maybe after reading that, you have a causal model in your head: no concentration to shatter -&gt; no model that [cubicle -&gt; brain in a blender vs not]. And, people in charge of facilities (have no concentration to shatter) -&gt; feel cubicles are good; hackers (have concentration to shatter) -&gt; feel cubicles are bad; hence, a disconnect over cubicles. (Wow, he packed all that in two sentences.)</p>
<p>Similarly, correlations are not causal models. “Obesity is <em>associated</em> with heart disease” is not good enough. You need to build and test the causal model. Similarly for graphs and other representations of correlations.</p>
<p><strong>JPD</strong>: Look at all the possible states of the world (or paths of the world, if you’re modelling it over time).</p>
<pre><code>| RAIny | Cool  | Probability |
|-----------------------------|
| False | False | 50%         |
| False | True  | 30%         |
| True  | False | 1%          |
| True  | True  | 19%         |

| Exercise | Internet | Overweight | Probability |

40 binary variables, 2^40 possible states and thus that many entries in the JPD</code></pre>
<p><strong>Value of information</strong>: The daily news has pretty much no expected value of information for you regarding what you will eat tonight - it can’t change your meal choice either way (unless it says that your favourite noodles contain toxic chemicals). Call and ask if the gym is open - high expected value of information - if it’s open, then I will go; if not, I won’t bother walking all the way there. With probabilities: let’s say I estimate the probability of the gym being open to be 90%. So, 90% of the time, I expect the person to say that the gym is open. In that case, I would walk to the gym as planned. There would be no change in my plan. But, if he said that the gym is closed, then I won’t waste my time walking all the way and back. I’d stay at home and save the cost of walking. Since I expect this to happen 10% of the time, the expected value of information (I think) is 10% x cost of walking.</p>
<p>I think I can theorize that expected value of perfect information = probability of my original choice being wrong x the value I’d gain by making the right choice instead.</p>
<p>Why? Because when somebody reaffirms your choice, it doesn’t add any value. You would have done it anyway. So, information is only valuable when you think it has a chance of telling you that you made the wrong choice.</p>
<p>Example from How to Measure Anything: Campaign: Success - 80% chance, profit $30 million; Failure - 20% chance, profit -$10 million No Campaign: Success - 100% chance, +$0 million Expected value of perfect information if you decided to do the campaign = 20% chance of it being the wrong choice x $10 million if you didn’t run the campaign = $2 million. Expected value of perfect information if you decided <em>not</em> to do the campaign = 80% chance of it being the wrong choice x $30 million if you ran the campaign = $24 million.</p>
<p>Still not fully clear about expected value of information.</p>
<p><strong>Locality of causality</strong>: The error must be close to the point where the program crashed. The mould must be caused by something close to the kitchen stove. The pain in my back must have been caused by something I did recently.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative hypotheses</strong>: panic attacks are caused by biochemical problems vs wrong interpretation of bodily symptoms. India will win vs the other team will win (that’s hardly a hypothesis). The part of the rat’s brain they discovered was the pleasure centre vs the desire centre.</p>
<p><strong>Information</strong>: 12-ball weighing problem - each <em>message</em> from the weighing machine (left heavier, equal, right-heavier) gives you information. The simple warship game gives you two possible messages: you’ve hit a warship or you’ve not. The news tells you who won the elections.</p>
<p><strong>Entropy and uncertainty</strong>: You estimate a certain amount of entropy for each ensemble of messages, like in the ball-weighing game, where you have a maximum of ~1.58 bits of entropy about the set of three messages (when they seem equally likely). In a program with 10 binary variables where you don’t know anything about its current state, you have 2^10 x 1/2^10 x log(2^10) = 10 bits of uncertainty about the current values. In the ball-weighing game, your total uncertainty is log2(24) = ~4.58 bits and you estimate ~1.58 bits of entropy at best from each weighing, so you expect it to take no less than ~2.89 weighings at best. So, you can’t expect to do it in two weighings - an adversary can set up the balls so that your judgment fails.</p>
<p><strong>harsh tests (high entropy)</strong>: Test for the <code>square</code> function: <code>square 2826 == 7986276</code> - I have no clue whether my function will give that answer, so if it does, that’s super-strong information.</p>
<p><strong>Expected uncertainty reduction</strong>: Ball-weighing example - what was your initial uncertainty? 24 possible hypotheses (ball 1 heavier, ball 1 lighter, and so on for 12 balls) all of which seem equally likely to you. So, 24 x 1/24 x log2(1/24) = ~4.59 bits of uncertainty. The first ball-weighing with 4 balls per pan gives you ~1.58 bits of entropy. What is your expected uncertainty after that? Is it ~4.59 - ~1.58 = 3 bits? (Note: log2(24) - log2(3) = exactly 3 bits)</p>
<p>Take the message “left pan lighter than right pan” - you’ve now eliminated the hypotheses where the odd ball was outside the pans, or where a heavier ball was on the left side or a lighter ball on the right side. So, that’s 8 + 4 + 4 = 16 hypotheses eliminated, leaving 8 hypotheses. Your uncertainty now is -log2(1/8) = 3 bits. Similarly, for the message “left pan heavier than right pan”, you eliminate 16 hypotheses and are left with 8 hypotheses for an uncertainty of 3 bits. Now for the message “both pans are equal” - you eliminate the hypotheses that say the odd ball is on one of the pans, leaving the 8 hypotheses about the balls outside, for an uncertainty of 3 bits. Thus, after getting the first message, you expect an uncertainty of 3 bits no matter the message. So, expected uncertainty = 3 x 1/3 x 3 = 3 bits.</p>
<p>Well, in the extreme case, you expect that N messages of entropy U/N will reduce a total of uncertainty of U to zero. So, entropy seems like it is <em>expected</em> uncertainty reduction. You have to consider the different messages and your uncertainty in those possible worlds. My only problem is that I’m not able to derive this mathematically.</p>
<p><strong>Categories</strong>: Robins and crows seem like prototypical birds; ostriches don’t. But they still seem more bird-y than Abraham Lincoln. In baseball, we have different categories for curve balls and fast pitches. We have movie genres like comedy, action, biopic, and drama. When I write an essay, I’m not reading a book or taking a walk.</p>
<p><strong>Empiricism and naive realism</strong>: You think there’s no chilli powder left in the cupboard. But you go and check anyway, and what do you find? You think you’ve been using some technique a lot, but then you start actually keeping count… and the results are not pleasing. You fight with somebody else over how likely it <em>is</em> that some politician will get elected, but you don’t realize that probability exists in the mind, not in reality. You think some problem is really hard to solve, but it is just that <em>you</em> think it is complex and hard to solve. It may not actually be so.</p>
<p><strong>Taboo</strong>: “boundaries” = property rights = things for which only you can say yes or no, because you’re willing to pay the price to make it happen; things whose value to you exceeds their opportunity cost. “information” = amount by which this message multiplies your confidence in the correct hypothesis. “falsifiability” = being able to recognize this value or its alternatives in the real world, by expressing the abstract concept in terms of concrete sub-concepts (example: “that was a marvellous cover drive” - what isn’t a marvellous cover drive?).</p>
<p><strong>Look only at the differing predictions</strong>: Laptop keeps crashing because of overheating due to dust or overheating due to graphics card problem - well, if it crashes even after cleaning the dust, it can’t be because of the dust. Between the spontaneous generation of life theory and life generates life theory: Pasteur prevented living things from coming in contact with the broth and showed that maggots wouldn’t form on its surface. Differing prediction between biochemistry theory of panic attacks and cognitive theory of panic attacks: can you prevent a panic attack even in the presence of sodium lactate?</p>
<p><strong>What would falsify your hypothesis</strong>: If you predicted that stocks would go up, then if they go down, your theory is wrong. “The Dark Knight is the best movie ever” - what would falsify this? What if it isn’t at #1 on the IMDB list? What if you’ve watched it fewer times than movies you say you like less, for example, The Terminator? If you say Dhoni is the best finisher in the world right now, but he has a T20 strike rate of only about 120, then is your theory wrong? What would you have predicted? Seriously? You’re not surprised that his strike rate is lower than that of Kohli or just about any other half-decent T20 batsman?</p>
<p><strong>mysterious answers (variables whose values you can’t or don’t test)</strong>: phlogiston vs not; God is omniscient and benevolent vs not; Wulky Wilkinsen is post-utopian vs not; shows colonial alienation vs not; elan vital vs not; whether something is conscious or not. Examples of non-mysterious things (aka variables): is this the square of a number or not (well, it’s an easily comparable number)? “salacious” vs not; “opprobrium” vs not; how long will a ball take to reach the ground? (The point is not that there’s a formula to get t from h and g. The point is that we can <em>falsify</em> a prediction for t; If you say it takes 5 seconds, but it takes 3 seconds, I can tell that you’re wrong.)</p>
<p><strong>decisions</strong>: should I go to bed now or not? what shall I have for dinner - cooked meal, pizza, or chaat? shall I catch this crowded bus or wait for another one? <strong>non-decisions</strong>: “this is a laptop” is not a decision, it’s just the value of a variable (laptop vs not). “Smoking causes cancer” is not a decision. Also, when standing at the bus stop, “shall I now eat a burger or fly a plane?” is not a decision - those options are not available to you right now. I guess you call it a decision when you consider the choices to be part of a single variable.</p>
<p><strong>variable vs not a variable</strong>: Qwerty is not a variable, it’s a category, the <em>value</em> of a variable; smoking causes cancer is not a variable, it’s a branch of a causal model; more food is better than less, all else being equal - is not a variable. iPhone vs Galaxy Note forms a variable (smartphone); straight drive vs leg glance vs … is a variable - which stroke to play; 30 kph or 50 kph is a variable.</p>
<p><strong>value of a variable</strong>: keyboard layout - Qwerty vs Dvorak; sabotage vs no sabotage; witch vs not a witch;</p>
<p><strong>decoupling or orthogonality (as opposed to un-orthogonal)</strong>: The sort function is decoupled from the function calling it, given its type signature and QC property - you can use it without knowing about its other callees. The controls of a helicopter are apparently un-orthogonal: you can’t use one without knowing the state of another; it seems that the different important parts of a helicopter all depend on several controls, so when you change even just one control, all the parts change; God help you if change more than one control at the same time. When you lie to many people who know each other, you can’t tell one person a new lie without knowing the previous lies you’ve told either them or the people they know; however, when you tell the truth, you can just answer their question without thinking about the past. Therefore, the lie you tell depends on not only the truth but also the lies you’ve told and the lies you expect to tell.</p>
<p><strong>fun vs boring (to whom?)</strong>: Things that are considered fun by the people I know - going out to an “exciting” new restaurant (like a fancy buffet or Arabic restaurant) vs the same neighbourhood restaurant, watching new movies, listening to hot new songs, getting excited about movie trailers, travelling to the beach, mall, or other cool location in a motorbike or car, binge-drinking at home, doing weed, hiking, flying an aeroplane, bungee-jumping or other adventure sports, cooking fancy dishes whose pics you can upload on FB, shopping, and, of course, hanging out with members of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Things considered boring by the people I know - watching the same movie more than once, especially with friends, doing the same thing two outings in a row, staying at home on weekends, reading books, eating the same meal again, listening to songs or watching movies that are not currently popular, sitting and studying for long periods of time, talking about “serious” matters (like money, studies, philosophy of life - what you should do, what gives you meaning, the futility of consumerism, global warming, sustainability, rationality, important scientific ideas about willpower and positive psychology).</p>
<p>Diagnostic cue: Not doing the same thing again. New movies, restaurants, or songs, not old ones.</p>
<p>It’s like they’re conquering a map of “popular activities” and they want to expand their territory as much as possible. Traversing the same territory (activity) over and over doesn’t help them. Note: Their happiness doesn’t have anything to do with it. I’ve seen people obsess over movie trailers and repeatedly get disappointed after the actual movie (Superman comes to mind). They would do better by watching classic, tried-and-tested movies.</p>
<p>Also, perhaps there’s an opportunity cost to doing things that make you happy. Watching old movies may make you happy, but you miss out on the chance to watch a new one and keep up with all your friends. Maybe it’s all Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO).</p>
<p>Wait. Think in terms of status and tribes. If we accept the hypothesis that humans want to seem high-status within their various sub-tribes, then they would want to display the pertinent signals of high status. Like watching all the latest cool movies, visiting cool locations and uploading pics on FB, typing witty comments on Whatsapp, etc. Maybe it’s all an elaborate status contest. Basically, they will want to mimic high-status individuals and distance themselves from low-status individuals. In particular, the actual benefits of the activity don’t enter the picture at any point. Test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Question: Isn’t this idiotic? Should you respect this?</p>
<p><strong>decision-oriented thinking</strong>: How deep should your understanding of your laptop be? Should you understand the physics on which your silicon processor runs? Why not? Next, how long should you study a viral disease or a car engine? Only as much as you need to make your decisions (about quarantining carriers). You have two information sources - a textbook and a news article; which one should you read if you only have time for one? The one that you expect to change your decision the most.</p>
<p>How to judge the importance of a medium? Look at the decisions it changes. How many decisions have you changed because of a tweet? Depends. If someone tweets about emergency instructions during a flood or about a blood shortage at a hospital, then you might take action. Otherwise, it’s just entertainment most of the time.</p>
<p>Contrast this to the thinking that you have to read a book from cover to cover. Or that you have to collect data meticulously, without spilling a single drop. Or that you have to consider all data to be equal, without privileging any of it over the other, like in a scientific journal, where you’re given a mass of graphs and statistics, with no natural order.</p>
<p>Anytime you invest your time and money in information sources without considering their value, you’re failing to think in terms of decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So I hope it is self-evident that reframing seemingly-paradoxical probability problems as decision problems generally makes them trivial, or at least agreeably solvable and non-paradoxical. What may be more controversial is that I claim that this is satisfactory not as a circumvention but as a dissolution of the question “What probability should be assigned to x?”, when you have a clear enough idea of why you’re wondering about the “probability.” Can we really taboo concepts like “probability” and “plausibility” and “credence”? I should certainly hope so; judgments of probability had better be about something, and not just rituals of cognition that we use because it seems like we’re supposed to rather than because it wins.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>But when I try to replace “probability” with what I mean by it, and when I mean it in any normative sense … then I always find myself talking about optimal bets or average experimental outcomes. Can that really be all there is to probability as degree of belief? Can’t we enjoy, for its own sake, the experience of having maximally accurate beliefs given whatever information we already have, even in circumstances where we don’t get to test it any further? Well, yes and no; if your belief is really about anything, then you’ll be able to specify, at the very least, a ridiculous hypothetical experiment that would give you information about how correct you are, or a ridiculous hypothetical bet that would give you an incentive to optimally solve a more well-defined version of the problem. And if you’re working with a problem where it’s at all unclear how to do this, it is probably best to backtrack and ask what problem you’re trying to solve, why you’re asking the question in the first place.</p>
<p>So when in doubt, ask for decisions rather than probabilities. In the end, the point (aside from signaling) of believing things is (1) to allow you to effectively optimize reality for the things you care about, and (2) to allow you to be surprised by some possible experiences and not others so you get feedback on how well you’re doing. If a belief does not do either of those things, I’d hesitate to call it a belief at all; yet that is what the original version of the Sleeping Beauty problem asks you to do.</p>

<p><strong>procrastination</strong>: colonoscopy, will, credit card debt, savings, preventable diseases, loved ones who die (from The Procrastination Equation). non-procrastination? doing an item on your to-do list like exercising in the evening, or doing something even more important (like booking train tickets or following through on an important idea like deep work).</p>
<p><strong>not an explanation vs is an explanation</strong>: magic, “neurons have gone through the code”.</p>
<p>Why is “magic” a bad category? I think it’s because it’s not an empirical category. It changes from people to people. A fighter plane may seem like magic to me but not to you. So, it reflects only your own ignorance, not the object itself. Stop treating it like it will tell you anything useful about the object.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During one conversation, I said something about there being no magic in our universe.</p>
<p>And an ordinary-seeming woman responded, “But there are still lots of things science doesn’t understand, right?”</p>
<p>Sigh. We all know how this conversation is going to go, right?</p>
<p>So I wearily replied with my usual, “If I’m ignorant about a phenomenon, that is a fact about my state of mind, not a fact about the phenomenon itself; a blank map does not correspond to a blank territory -”</p>
<p>“Oh,” she interrupted excitedly, “so the concept of ‘magic’ isn’t even consistent, then!”</p>

<p>bad explanations: Harry has some hidden power to vanquish the Dark Lord, magic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For whatever reason, then, most of the Wizengamot has never walked the path that leads to powerful wizardry; they do not seek out what is hidden. For them, there is no why. There is no explanation. There is no causality. … Ten years earlier they were told that a one-year-old boy defeated the most terrible Dark Lord of their generation, perhaps the most evil Dark Lord ever to live; and they just accepted that too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It was, but…” Harry said. “Um. The laws governing what constitutes a good explanation don’t talk about plausible excuses you hear afterward. They talk about the probabilities we assign in advance. That’s why science makes people do advance predictions, instead of trusting explanations people come up with afterward. And I wouldn’t have predicted in advance for you to follow Snape and show up like that. Even if I’d known in advance that you could put a trace on Snape’s wand, I wouldn’t have expected you to do it and follow him just then. Since your explanation didn’t make me feel like I would have predicted the outcome in advance, it remained an improbability.</p>

<p>“Just the obvious one,” Hermione said, kicking her legs slightly over the rooftop’s edge. “I thought maybe when You-Know-Who died right next to you, he happened to give off the burst of magic that makes a ghost, and some of it imprinted on your brain instead of the floor. But that never felt right to me, like it was just a clever explanation that wasn’t actually true, and it makes even less sense if You-Know-Who didn’t really die that night.”</p>

<p><strong>relentlessly resourceful</strong>: Joe Kraus and Vinod Khosla at Excite - they pushed and got the Netscape deal despite losing the bid; Joe Kraus got a VP of Marketing even though the guy bailed at the last moment.</p>
<p><strong>lost purposes</strong>: cricket - “you must have a great technique like Sachin or Dravid or Kohli”. Why? Technique used to be important because cricket was dangerous and you needed to be safe from fast bowlers (and also because you needed to handle tough swing bowling). But now, with all the safety gear and flat pitches, you need have no fear. Somebody like ABD can change the game with his fearless batting.</p>
<p><strong>map vs territory</strong>: Sleeping Beauty problem <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/32o/if_a_tree_falls_on_sleeping_beauty/">on LessWrong</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And on reflection, considering my confusion rather than trying to consider the question on its own terms, it seems to me that the problem (as it’s normally stated) is completely a tree-falling-in-the-forest problem: a debate about the normatively “correct” degree of credence which only seemed like an issue because any conclusions about what Sleeping Beauty “should” believe weren’t paying their rent, were disconnected from any expectation of feedback from reality about how right they were.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>deliberate practice and intense training</strong>: Virat Kohli - consistent intense training.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But one of the most remarkable and constant aspects of his batting has been the absence of unorthodoxy. “It [persisting with his methods] is a conscious effort, to be very honest. It is more like <strong>‘Eat, sleep, train, repeat’</strong>. If you want to be consistent, you need to be <em>boring</em> with your training, your food and your batting habits,” Kohli said.</p>

<p><strong>signalling</strong>: signalling at all times - essay (I take pains to make sure an essay isn’t awful); ditto for seeming intelligent to friends.</p>
<p><strong>diagnostic cues</strong>: Raina will score more than 400 runs vs not (“Raina had a good IPL”). Expected value distinguishes what action I should take - eat junk food or good food. Maintaining your boundaries vs not: is your property being used in line with your wishes? Live births distinguish mammals from reptiles and others.</p>
<p><strong>mutual information</strong>: Online article gives some reasons why smart, hardworking people may not find success. This implies that smart, hardworking people don’t find much success. Well, <em>most people</em> never find “success”. If you say that being smart and hardworking makes you less likely to succeed, then being dumb or lazy must make you more likely to succeed. But IQ and conscientiousness are correlated with higher success. So, the article was just plausible-sounding crap. Lesson: Don’t postulate correlations without looking at the other side.</p>
<p><strong>it’s not magic</strong>: Ericsson, in the book Peak, takes pains to point out that the skill of prodigies is not magic. It’s completely mundane and explainable by practice. Eliezer <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/qs/einsteins_superpowers/">says</a> that Julian Barbour “seemed to have seen through Einstein - he talked about Einstein as if everything Einstein had done was perfectly understandable and mundane”.</p>
<p><strong>top idea in your mind</strong>: PG - raising money in a startup (or just making money, in general); also, disputes - what I would call status battles; me - social interactions and thinking about how others had treated me poorly;</p>
<p>Not the top idea: effective altruism and how we need to maximize utilons, not status or warm fuzzies; the Long Now and the effects of our actions in the long run, instead of just the next week;</p>
<p><strong>one concrete example giving huge benefits</strong>: <code>2 + 2 = 4</code> leading to my understanding of the importance of value of information in forming concepts and how you can’t create models without decisions in mind. Summarizing the Willpower Instinct taught me the importance of correlations and interventions (I think). Struggling with even a simple biology textbook taught me the harsh limitations of my understanding of rationality. Working with the simple ball-weighing example taught me about the monumental concept of entropy and sparked interest in systemizing my model of information theory. Again, the simple ad-making example by Douglas Hubbard taught me a lot about EVI (= expected increase in maximum expected value).</p>
<p>Failing when I think abstractly: “figure out taboo” - was blank for ages. Back in the prehistoric days, I used to talk about hypotheses and evidence without having any concrete example backing them. Ditto for my essays on “confusion” - they’re exhibit number one for confused thinking. I just kept repeating the phrase “map and territory” like a broken record, hoping it would do something.</p>
<p><strong>concrete examples leading to great progress</strong>: One skill of blackjack basic strategy demystified much of “categories and causal models” for me and straightened my path for the future; reading about instances of deliberate practice in The Talent Code and Talent is Overrated sparked lots of ideas; scrutinizing the examples in Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions led me to my idea of floating belief = lack of fixed categorizing mechanism and also that of incomplete causal models; reading some Stevey essays, my old java code, and some chapters from Refactoring triggered ideas about how we need to have minimum information at all points so as to minimize uncertainty and maximize reusability.</p>
<p><strong>repeated fresh attacks</strong>: I think I made a lot of attempts on reducing information theory to probability theory.</p>
<p><strong>not celebrating too soon</strong>: Functions in terms of information theory.</p>
<p>counter-example: golfers when they putt - they celebrate before the ball is in the hole.</p>
<p><strong>shut up and do the impossible</strong>: HPMOR - Azkaban, troll, final exam; Hunger Games - shooting at the roof upon lightning; Looper - killing himself.</p>
<p><strong>chunking theory vs schemata</strong>: concrete vs abstract information. For example, they differ on whether memory of chess patterns depends on their position on the board - whether a bishop and pawn in the middle is different from a bishop and pawn in the corner (I don’t know chess).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The former alternative would explain expertise as a product of <em>very specific</em> recognizable perceptual chunks and associated productions that evoke from memory information about their significance. The latter hypothesis would explain expertise as based upon <em>general-purpose</em> schemas whose variables can have different values in different situations.</p>
<p>In the former case, a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for expertise would be possession of a large number of productions conditioned on <em>specific</em> patterns (e.g., chess patterns noticed on the board). In the latter case, <em>fewer</em> schemas would be needed for expertise, for schemas could be instantiated differently from case to case, but instantiation would increase the time required to acquire a schema.</p>
<p>Templates are simply chunks having slots in which some additional information can be stored rapidly</p>
<p>– <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225336454_Recall_of_random_and_distorted_positions_Implications_for_the_theory_of_expertise">Gobet and Simon 1996</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, chunks are very <em>concrete</em> pieces of information? I kept thinking of chunks as general-purpose programs. Hmmm… If so, this could make it even more important to think only in terms of concrete examples.</p>
<p>But how are we able to apply concepts across domains? Take the art of skimming books. I can do that whether it’s an economics textbook, science journal paper, or Agatha Christie novel. But the specific cues differ from book to book. In fact, the key question is: what cues do we use to chunk? If those cues are rigid and domain-specific, like the board positions in chess, then we won’t be able to use those chunks even if it’s the same pattern of pieces but in another area of the board. However, if those cues are domain-independent, like “read the first line of the paragraph”, then I can use them on any paragraph (while skimming), no matter the content.</p>
<p>All this tells us is that you can’t use a chunk for something it wasn’t designed to do. The main result here was that chess players <em>don’t</em> represent chess patterns independent of location, because location matters to the game. Chess players <em>could</em> have chosen to represent the patterns regardless of location, but they didn’t. The moral is that we don’t have fine enough control over our chunks to make them ignore variables (like location or colour).</p>
<p><strong>pattern-matching vs deliberate reasoning</strong>: The better your pattern-matching abilities, the better your performance. However, that doesn’t mean reasoning doesn’t matter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key finding was that performance in blitz chess correlated highly (between +0.78 and +0.90) with performance in normal chess, which accords with theoretical prediction. However, it was emphatically not the case that slow search processes were irrelevant. The same players playing chess under normal conditions and under blitz conditions made <em>superior</em> moves in the former condition, which provided much more time for <em>slow searching</em>.</p>

<p><strong>heroes who ask for payment before they will help</strong>: Vegeta in Dragon Ball Z - he agrees to help Goku and the others to fight the Ginyu force and later Frieza but only so that he can gain immortality. Piccolo is similarly mercenary in the beginning of DBZ - he agrees to help Goku only to get rid of the common Saiyan threat, for selfish reasons, not because he wants to save the world.</p>

<p>high-status vs low-status</p>
<p>respect - not what you wish it to be, but what it actually is</p>
<p>like vs dislike - why should it even matter? Is that a magical category? Remember that you’re a consequentialist. Also, charm is another thing - maybe it can persuade people where profits can’t.</p>
<p>moral vs immoral behaviour: you feel it’s bad to “infringe on other people’s autonomy”, but what’s the alternative? How can you act without infringing?</p>
<p>Consequentialism is more fundamental than the “property rights” or “personal autonomy” or other such moral heuristics. Yes, you want to have certain near-injunctions like don’t kill or don’t steal. But at the end of the day, they’re still heuristics. Breaking them may be justified in some situations.</p>
<p>The same holds for the heuristic that you shouldn’t “infringe on others’ property” - by forcing your son to follow a career he doesn’t want, using Dark Arts to persuade a customer to buy a product he doesn’t need (probably all modern-day consumer crap), or wasting your friend’s time by not showing up for a planned outing. Ditto for insulting others (and making them feel insecure), breaking your promises, or ignoring what people say in conversation.</p>
<p>Consequentialism overrules the intuitive moral heuristic that these things are wrong. Yes, a world where your friend wasn’t hurt by your insult or the customer didn’t buy the useless product is <em>better</em> than a world where they did, all else being equal. However, all else is not equal. Maybe you’re going to make money from the customer and use it for some worthy cause that outweighs the (value to you of the) damage done to him. (This still seems like a slippery slope to me, but I’m not able to justify it formally).</p>
<p>Here’s a test: can you not conceive of any situation where breaking your promise or using marketing techniques is the right thing to do? Can the resulting situation be better than any alternatives?</p>
<p>Judge the outcomes, not the actions. You did X (smoked cigarettes, lied, cheated, insulted) - is that good or bad? Well, is the world better off than the alternative, in your opinion? Did you get enough utilons from the cigarettes that it was worth the risk of addiction and lung damage? You insulted people to become more popular - is that good or bad? Depends on what happened? Did you use your power to do good things or bad things? Of course, you have to be honest with yourself and admit it when you were just being stupid, but that’s another thing. Morality is not at fault there; you are.</p>

<h1 id="aim">Aim</h1>
<p>Come up with three exemplars for each concept so that I have concrete cues on which to recall them, instead of some abstract labels I can’t apply.</p>
<p>Why do we need exemplars? So that we can learn to categorize an abstract concept from concrete situations, instead of just working with unproductive, floating labels like “neoliberalism” or “opprobrium”.</p>
<p>Also, list the counter-examples for that category, i.e., exemplars for the alternative values. Like the way “Ubuntu” is an alternative to “Windows” for the variable of closed-source vs open-source operating systems. This way I can categorize every possible value for that variable.</p>
<p>In fact, specify the diagnostic cues for each category. Like for mysterious concepts: the diagnostic cue is whether you have a diagnostic cue (example: elan vital vs not, better performance vs not).</p>
<p>Whenever I need to use or explain a concept, I should refer to its exemplars here. That way I’ll keep this list current and usable. Ditto for when I have a new idea about a concept - I can test it out on these exemplars.</p>
<h1 id="concepts">Concepts</h1>
<p><strong>Causal models</strong>: a = F/m. depression &lt;- rumination about pessimistic explanations vs not. willpower &lt;- energy available in your brain for self-control, your self-control habits.</p>
<p><strong>JPD</strong>: Look at all the possible states of the world (or paths of the world, if you’re modelling it over time).</p>
<pre><code>| RAIny | Cool  | Probability |
|-----------------------------|
| False | False | 50%         |
| False | True  | 30%         |
| True  | False | 1%          |
| True  | True  | 19%         |

| Exercise | Internet | Overweight | Probability |

40 binary variables, 2^40 possible states and thus that many entries in the JPD</code></pre>
<p><strong>Value of information</strong>: The daily news has pretty much no expected value of information for you regarding what you will eat tonight - it can’t change your meal choice either way (unless it says that your favourite noodles contain toxic chemicals). Call and ask if the gym is open - high expected value of information - if it’s open, then I will go; if not, I won’t bother walking all the way there. With probabilities: let’s say I estimate the probability of the gym being open to be 90%. So, 90% of the time, I expect the person to say that the gym is open. In that case, I would walk to the gym as planned. There would be no change in my plan. But, if he said that the gym is closed, then I won’t waste my time walking all the way and back. I’d stay at home and save the cost of walking. Since I expect this to happen 10% of the time, the expected value of information (I think) is 10% x cost of walking.</p>
<p>I think I can theorize that expected value of perfect information = probability of my original choice being wrong x the value I’d gain by making the right choice instead.</p>
<p>Why? Because when somebody reaffirms your choice, it doesn’t add any value. You would have done it anyway. So, information is only valuable when you think it has a chance of telling you that you made the wrong choice.</p>
<p>Example from How to Measure Anything: Campaign: Success - 80% chance, profit $30 million; Failure - 20% chance, profit -$10 million No Campaign: Success - 100% chance, +$0 million Expected value of perfect information if you decided to do the campaign = 20% chance of it being the wrong choice x $10 million if you didn’t run the campaign = $2 million. Expected value of perfect information if you decided <em>not</em> to do the campaign = 80% chance of it being the wrong choice x $30 million if you ran the campaign = $24 million.</p>
<p>Still not fully clear about expected value of information.</p>
<p><strong>Locality of causality</strong>: The error must be close to the point where the program crashed. The mould must be caused by something close to the kitchen stove. The pain in my back must have been caused by something I did recently.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative hypotheses</strong>: panic attacks are caused by biochemical problems vs wrong interpretation of bodily symptoms. India will win vs the other team will win (that’s hardly a hypothesis). The part of the rat’s brain they discovered was the pleasure centre vs the desire centre.</p>
<p><strong>Information</strong>: 12-ball weighing problem - each <em>message</em> from the weighing machine (left heavier, equal, right-heavier) gives you information. The simple warship game gives you two possible messages: you’ve hit a warship or you’ve not. The news tells you who won the elections.</p>
<p><strong>Entropy and uncertainty</strong>: You estimate a certain amount of entropy for each ensemble of messages, like in the ball-weighing game, where you have a maximum of ~1.58 bits of entropy about the set of three messages (when they seem equally likely). In a program with 10 binary variables where you don’t know anything about its current state, you have 2^10 x 1/2^10 x log(2^10) = 10 bits of uncertainty about the current values. In the ball-weighing game, your total uncertainty is log2(24) = ~4.58 bits and you estimate ~1.58 bits of entropy at best from each weighing, so you expect it to take no less than ~2.89 weighings at best. So, you can’t expect to do it in two weighings - an adversary can set up the balls so that your judgment fails.</p>
<p><strong>Categories</strong>: Robins and crows seem like prototypical birds; ostriches don’t. But they still seem more bird-y than Abraham Lincoln. In baseball, we have different categories for curve balls and fast pitches. We have movie genres like comedy, action, biopic, and drama.</p>
<p><strong>Empiricism and naive realism</strong>: You think there’s no chilli powder left in the cupboard. But you go and check anyway, and what do you find? You think you’ve been using some technique a lot, but then you start actually keeping count… and the results are not pleasing. You fight with somebody else over how likely it <em>is</em> that some politician will get elected, but you don’t realize that probability exists in the mind, not in reality. You think some problem is really hard to solve, but it is just that <em>you</em> think it is complex and hard to solve. It may not actually be so.</p>
<p><strong>Taboo</strong>: “boundaries” = property rights = things for which only you can say yes or no, because you’re willing to pay the price to make it happen; things whose value to you exceeds their opportunity cost. “information” = amount by which this message multiplies your confidence in the correct hypothesis. “falsifiability” = being able to recognize this value or its alternatives in the real world, by expressing the abstract concept in terms of concrete sub-concepts (example: “that was a marvellous cover drive” - what isn’t a marvellous cover drive?).</p>
<p><strong>Look only at the differing predictions</strong>: Laptop keeps crashing because of overheating due to dust or overheating due to graphics card problem - well, if it crashes even after cleaning the dust, it can’t be because of the dust. Between the spontaneous generation of life theory and life generates life theory: Pasteur prevented living things from coming in contact with the broth and showed that maggots wouldn’t form on its surface. Differing prediction between biochemistry theory of panic attacks and cognitive theory of panic attacks: can you prevent a panic attack even in the presence of sodium lactate?</p>
<p><strong>What would falsify your hypothesis</strong>: If you predicted that stocks would go up, then if they go down, your theory is wrong. “The Dark Knight is the best movie ever” - what would falsify this? What if it isn’t at #1 on the IMDB list? What if you’ve watched it fewer times than movies you say you like less, for example, The Terminator? If you say Dhoni is the best finisher in the world right now, but he has a T20 strike rate of only about 120, then is your theory wrong? What would you have predicted? Seriously? You’re not surprised that his strike rate is lower than that of Kohli or just about any other half-decent T20 batsman?</p>
<p><strong>mysterious answers (variables whose values you can’t or don’t test)</strong>: phlogiston vs not; God is omniscient and benevolent vs not; Wulky Wilkinsen is post-utopian vs not; shows colonial alienation vs not; elan vital vs not; whether something is conscious or not. Examples of non-mysterious things (aka variables): is this the square of a number or not (well, it’s an easily comparable number)? “salacious” vs not; “opprobrium” vs not; how long will a ball take to reach the ground? (The point is not that there’s a formula to get t from h and g. The point is that we can <em>falsify</em> a prediction for t; If you say it takes 5 seconds, but it takes 3 seconds, I can tell that you’re wrong.)</p>
<p><strong>decisions</strong>: should I go to bed now or not? what shall I have for dinner - cooked meal, pizza, or chaat? shall I catch this crowded bus or wait for another one? <strong>non-decisions</strong>: “this is a laptop” is not a decision, it’s just the value of a variable (laptop vs not). “Smoking causes cancer” is not a decision. Also, when standing at the bus stop, “shall I now eat a burger or fly a plane?” is not a decision - those options are not available to you right now. I guess you call it a decision when you consider the choices to be part of a single variable.</p>
<p><strong>variable vs not a variable</strong>: Qwerty is not a variable, it’s a category, the <em>value</em> of a variable; smoking causes cancer is not a variable, it’s a branch of a causal model; more food is better than less, all else being equal - is not a variable. iPhone vs Galaxy Note forms a variable (smartphone); straight drive vs leg glance vs … is a variable - which stroke to play; 30 kph or 50 kph is a variable.</p>
<p><strong>value of a variable</strong>: keyboard layout - Qwerty vs Dvorak; sabotage vs no sabotage; witch vs not a witch;</p>
<p><strong>decoupling or orthogonality (as opposed to un-orthogonal)</strong>: The sort function is decoupled from the function calling it, given its type signature and QC property - you can use it without knowing about its other callees. The controls of a helicopter are apparently un-orthogonal: you can’t use one without knowing the state of another; it seems that the different important parts of a helicopter all depend on several controls, so when you change even just one control, all the parts change; God help you if change more than one control at the same time. When you lie to many people who know each other, you can’t tell one person a new lie without knowing the previous lies you’ve told either them or the people they know; however, when you tell the truth, you can just answer their question without thinking about the past. Therefore, the lie you tell depends on not only the truth but also the lies you’ve told and the lies you expect to tell.</p>

<p>type signatures in thinking</p>
<p>satisfying work fun failure long project deep work vulnerability courage worthiness perfectionism budget opportunity costs “worth it” 10,000 hours of practice deliberate practice causal thinking serve the system utilons</p>
<p>beyond reasonable doubt vs Bayesian evidence: when is there a difference? Is it when people try to game the system? How exactly?</p>
<p>politics (especially:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we want to understand politics, I feel like one of the most important subgoals is to figure out the precise ways in which these sorts of alignments arise - in other words, how class warfare solves its coordination problems without most of the people involved being aware of what they’re doing or holding any explicitly sinister thoughts.</p>

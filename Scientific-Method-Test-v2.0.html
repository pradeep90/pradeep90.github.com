<h1 id="scientific-method-v2.0">Scientific Method v2.0</h1>
<p>Here’s my v2.0 algorithm: Take each correlation or observation and create several small causal structures that explain it. Think locally.</p>
<p>At each step, ask if it is a correlation or a cause. In the first pass, identify the correlations. Next, ensure that each part of your correlation is a variable. Operationalize, in other words. Then, investigate causes. Use time and space to figure out the direction of causality.</p>
<p>Mission: Use this on the HiSET (TM) Science Practice Test questions.</p>
<p>Time: 30 minutes</p>
<p>(Note: A -&gt; B stands for “A causes B”)</p>
<h1 id="the-test">The Test</h1>
<h2 id="experiment-1">Experiment 1</h2>
<p>Independent variables: identical cardboard boxes, does this box have sugar water, does this box have fragrant oil, time for exploration, position of the boxes.</p>
<p>Dependent variable: % of bees in each box;</p>
<p>Wait. What was the earlier evidence? None? Well, bees like sugar water, apparently. Also, they can’t magically find out where the sugar water is among identical boxes.</p>
<p>We care about whether bees can “smell” stuff, i.e., whether there is a variable about their brain state that changes based on the smells they perceive. Also, we want to know whether they can locate the source of the smell.</p>
<p>What do we expect them to do if they have such a “smell” variable?</p>
<p>One hypothesis (H1) is that the smell variable doesn’t cause anything at all. It gets set by the smell but the bee ignores it completely. But then, why would we expect it to be there at all? If we have no evidence at all that the smell variable exists, then we might as well posit that it doesn’t exist (call this H0). Except, maybe, we can see using a microscope that some part of the bee’s brain changes for different smells.</p>
<p>Another hypothesis (H2) is that the “smell” (and “source of smell”) variable causes the bee to behave differently - maybe the bee goes, in a predetermined way, towards flowers or objects that smell a certain way and avoids others (something like the way insects seem to go towards fluorescent lights). Basically, certain smells cause movement towards their source, independent of anything else. The bee’s movement depends only on the smell and its source.</p>
<p>Or, (H3) bees could associate smells with certain experiences and remember them in the future. (Note that we’re not being precise about what it really takes to get the bee to encode a smell-object association or how long it will remember it or anything. This is just a rough hypothesis differing starkly from the hypothesis that says it won’t remember anything, period). So, smell plus certain experiences cause them to store the smell-experience association in memory. Then, when they come across the same smell matching a smell in memory, they will behave as they would for the remembered experience (maybe go towards or away from the source of the smell). How will they behave when they come across a new smell? Maybe they will just do what they would normally do (?). Also, assume that the bees need several hours to store the smell-experience association in memory. So, the bee’s movement depends on the smell, its source, and on its memory of past experiences.</p>
<p>Another hypothesis (H4) could be that bees will be attracted to sugar water through some mysterious mechanism, regardless of any smell. Another hypothesis (H4’) could say that the bees will remember the position where they last encountered sugar water.</p>
<p>Ok. Now, how would I distinguish between H2 and H3? Well, first note that we can only observe the “movement” variable - we don’t have the equipment to look into the bee’s brain to see if its memory is updated for smells. Also, we can only manipulate the smell and source variables (and time). So, for the observed variable - movement - the only cause that differs between H2 and H3 is memory. So, change memory somehow. Then, they will predict different movements.</p>
<p>Also, H2 says that the movement will be towards the source of the smell no matter what. So, you should never get different behaviour for the same smell. But, H3 says that you will move towards the smell only after you’ve associated it with some desired experience (like sugar water). So, the first time you set sugar water and fragrant oil, the bee should move towards it as quickly as it does the second time around. “Learning” should have no effect on the speed of discovery.</p>
<p>Experiment 1 has cardboard boxes with one box containing sugar water and fragrant oil. Then, the bees are given several hours to explore the boxes. Even after switching the box positions, bees could easily find the box with sugar water and fragrant oil. (We’ll assume that bees usually take a while to find a box with sugar water in it.) So, this rules out H0 and H1, which both predict that the bee’s behaviour should not change in the presence of some smell, and also H4’, which says that the bee will remember the position of the sugar water and therefore stay in that position at least for a while. However, does it distinguish between H2 and H3? H2 says that bees will just move towards the source of some smell. H3 says that the bees will associate the fragrance with sugar water and thus move towards the source of the smell. In this experiment, though, they didn’t measure how quickly the bees found the fragrant box the first time around, so we can’t distinguish between H2 and H3 yet.</p>
<p>Later, the experimenter had fresh boxes with no sugar water, but with one box scented with the same fragrant oil as before. Bees moved towards only the fragrant box. This rules out H4 because there is no sugar water here. H2 and H3 both survive, though. (However, if we assume that in some other experiment untrained bees don’t move towards a scented box, then H2 is ruled out from the start. Only H3 will remain.)</p>
<h2 id="experiment-2">Experiment 2</h2>
<p>What kind of smell “memories” do these bees store, exactly?</p>
<p>Independent variables: train bee to remember some smell using sugar water (using the procedure in Experiment 2), smell in box</p>
<p>Dependent variables: #bees in five minutes</p>
<p>We now need to refine H3. We earlier saw that after “remembering some smell”, the bees would move towards it the next time, even if there were no sugar water. But, what exactly does “smell” mean? Given that it was trained on a particular smell A and not B, will the bee move towards B the next time? What if B is “similar” to A somehow? In short, how fine-grained is the smell-memory?</p>
<p>Another question is, what kinds of smells can bees encode in the first place? Perhaps they can’t store the smell of, say, chocolate in memory? Anyway, we’ll leave this question aside for the moment.</p>
<p>H5, which is based on H3, says that the bee’s brain compares the incoming smell with the stored smell with a certain fuzziness. So, it might go after smells that it hadn’t encountered before if they are “similar” enough to previous smells. H6 says “nonsense” to all of that - the bee will never go after a new smell.</p>
<p>The outcome of experiment 2 supports H5, because the bees did go into boxes with other smells that were quite similar to the original fragrance.</p>
<h1 id="lessons">Lessons</h1>
<p>Always think in terms of the immediate causes. Instead of talking about grand differences between hypotheses, just zoom in on one variable for which they posit different immediate causes. That’s all it takes. Locality of causality says that if some variable comes out differently according to two hypotheses, then the difference must be because of its parents; the rest of the model doesn’t matter. So, exercise the parent causes that are different and you will get evidence one way or another.</p>
<p>The dual of that is to think in terms of immediate effects. But, you can’t really isolate the effects on its direct children, can you? The effects will propagate to all the descendants, which doesn’t simplify your task in any way. Thinking in terms of immediate causes is useful because you can cut the causal graph off at the parents.</p>
<p>Corollary: Don’t think in terms of faraway causes. Keep it up close and personal.</p>
<p>Corollary: Alternative hypotheses are nothing but different immediate causes. So, to formulate an alternative hypothesis, just ask which variable’s immediate causes you are going to change. It’s not magic.</p>

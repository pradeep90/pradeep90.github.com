<h1 id="scientific-method-v2.0">Scientific Method v2.0</h1>
<p>Here’s my v2.0 algorithm: Take each correlation or observation and create several small causal structures that explain it. Think locally.</p>
<p>At each step, ask if it is a correlation or a cause. In the first pass, identify the correlations. Next, ensure that each part of your correlation is a variable. Operationalize, in other words. Then, investigate causes. Use time and space to figure out the direction of causality.</p>
<p>Mission: Use this on the HiSET (TM) Science Practice Test questions.</p>
<p>Time: 30 minutes</p>
<p>(Note: A -&gt; B stands for “A causes B”)</p>
<h1 id="the-test">The Test</h1>
<h2 id="experiment-1">Experiment 1</h2>
<p>Independent variables: identical cardboard boxes, does this box have sugar water, does this box have fragrant oil, time for exploration, position of the boxes.</p>
<p>Dependent variable: % of bees in each box;</p>
<p>Wait. What was the earlier evidence? None? Well, bees like sugar water, apparently. Also, they can’t magically find out where the sugar water is among identical boxes.</p>
<p>We care about whether bees can “smell” stuff, i.e., whether there is a variable about their brain state that changes based on the smells they perceive. Also, we want to know whether they can locate the source of the smell.</p>
<p>What do we expect them to do if they have such a “smell” variable?</p>
<p>One hypothesis (H1) is that the smell variable doesn’t cause anything at all. It gets set by the smell but the bee ignores it completely. But then, why would we expect it to be there at all? If we have no evidence at all that the smell variable exists, then we might as well posit that it doesn’t exist. Except, maybe, we can see using a microscope that some part of the bee’s brain changes for different smells.</p>
<p>Another hypothesis (H2) is that the “smell” (and “source of smell”) variable causes the bee to behave differently - maybe the bee goes, in a predetermined way, towards flowers or objects that smell a certain way and avoids others (something like the way insects seem to go towards fluorescent lights). Basically, certain smells cause movement towards their source, independent of anything else.</p>
<p>Or, (H3) bees could associate smells with certain experiences and remember them in the future. (Note that we’re not being precise about what it really takes to get the bee to encode a smell-object association or how long it will remember it or anything. This is just a rough hypothesis differing starkly from the hypothesis that says it won’t remember anything, period). So, smell plus certain experiences cause them to store the smell-experience association in memory. Then, when they come across the same smell matching a smell in memory, they will behave as they would for the remembered experience (maybe go towards or away from the source of the smell). How will they behave when they come across a new smell? Maybe they will just do what they would normally do (?). Also, assume that the bees need several hours to store the smell-experience association in memory.</p>
<p>Experiment 1 has cardboard boxes with one box containing sugar water and fragrant oil. Then, the bees are given several hours to explore the boxes. Even after switching the box positions, bees could easily find the box with sugar water and fragrant oil.</p>

<h1 id="scientific-method-v1.2">Scientific Method v1.2</h1>
<p>Let’s continue using my v1.0 algorithm: Look at each paragraph and get the causal link.</p>
<p>At each step, ask if it is a correlation or a cause. In the first pass, identify the correlations. Then, investigate causes. Use time and space to figure out the direction of causality. Finally, for every top-level variable, ask what its cause is.</p>
<p>Mission: Use this on one PG essay.</p>
<p>Time: 1 hour</p>
<p>(Note: A -&gt; B stands for “A causes B”)</p>
<h1 id="filters-that-fight-back-by-pg">Filters that Fight Back by PG</h1>
<h2 id="correlations">Correlations</h2>
<p>follow links in mails, improve accuracy of Bayesian spam filters</p>
<p>Some guy did it only in borderline cases. “Why only borderline cases?”, asks PG. Also, “why only once?”</p>
<p>following all mails, amusing side-effect</p>
<p>popular mail clients do this, spammer’s servers take severe pounding</p>
<p>attack, very highly targeted (high precision?)</p>
<p>no other attack, as highly targeted</p>
<p>punish mode, spider every link n times</p>
<p>current email system, too passive (?)</p>
<p>suggestions to fix the problem of passiveness, new protocols; this one, not so</p>
<p>huge volume of spam, so far worked in favour of spammer (higher chances of clicks); now, work against spammer (higher load on servers)</p>
<p>auto-retrieving spam filters, drive spammer’s costs up, sales down; bandwidth goes up like hell, servers halt, unavailable to gullible customers</p>
<p>rebound filters, want it only for suspected spammers (want very low false positives)</p>
<p>url sent to millions of people, spam url</p>
<p>submitting every http request in every email, fine nearly all the time (low false positives)</p>
<p>urls from free email services, not fine (false positive)</p>
<p>auto-retrieval + blacklists of spamvertized sites, protect legitimate sites (number of times legitimate sites are crawled), prevent abuse (people spam with legitimate sites’ urls to get them DoS’d)</p>
<p>sites on blacklist, alone crawled (% of crawled sites from blacklist)</p>
<p>site blacklisted, humans inspection</p>
<p>lifetime of spam at least several hours, easy to update a list, interfere with promotion of new site (how many people see the spam or visit site)</p>
<p>high-bandwidth connections (bandwidth), high-volume auto-retrieval only practical for them (cost per mail)</p>
<p>enough of such people, serious trouble (load on spam servers)</p>
<p>in order to reach a few gullible people (target %), spam everyone (volume)</p>
<p>non-gullible people (people with low #clicks on spam), collateral damage (not target, but still paying in time)</p>
<p>non-gullible people stop (or threaten to stop) gullible from responding (somehow decrease % gullible clicks), non-gullible people stop getting spam (amount of spam received by non-gullible people; what about spam received by gullible people?)</p>
<p>auto-retrieving spam filters, stop (or threaten to stop) gullible people from responding to spam (decrease #gullible clicks)</p>
<p>auto-retrieving spam filter, kill spam (#total spam goes to zero)? Not quite</p>
<p>biggest spammers (highest spam volume times number of mails), protect their servers against auto-retrieving filters (somehow not increase server load due to auto-retrieving filters)</p>
<p>easiest and cheapest way to protect their servers (cost, ease of implementation and maintenance), working unsubscribe links (boolean)</p>
<p>working unsubscribe links, necessity for smaller fry (i.e., if they didn’t do that, they would get high server loads)</p>
<p>auto-retrieving filters become common (#filter users), auto-unsubscribing filters (% of non-unsubscribed spam mails)</p>
<p>people who don’t use the right software, spam (along with OS crashes, viruses, popups)</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>Ensure that each part of your correlation or cause is a variable. Don’t deal with abstract nonsense. Operationalize, in other words.</p>

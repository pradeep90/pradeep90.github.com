<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>I want to learn the technique of Bayes Theorem.</p>
<p>For that, I need accurate instructions, a Feedback Mechanism, scenarios in which I would need to use the theorem, and lots of practice.</p>
<h1 id="v1.0">v1.0</h1>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="./Cycle-Time.html">Cycle Time</a>, I need to start with a Hello World v1.0 of the technique. This means having very simple instructions, a primitive Feedback Mechanism, one <em>real-world</em> scenario, and maybe a dozen repetitions as practice.</p>
<p>Simple instructions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Primitive Feedback Mechanism:</p>
<p>Hmmm… Predictive Power? That is, number of instances where I predicted the answer correctly.</p>
<p>One real-world scenario:</p>
<p>Essays vs Outlines?</p>
<hr />
<p>Let’s do it.</p>
<p>H1: Essays are more awesome.</p>
<p>H2: Outlines are more awesome.</p>
<p>Let’s pick up where we left at the end of the first experiment in <a href="./Essays-vs-Outlines.html">Essays vs Outlines</a>. I got some hunches about the nature of essays and outlines. Let’s examine those hypotheses now.</p>
<h2 id="hypotheses">Hypotheses</h2>
<p>Lots of starts and ends make you feel like you’ve written a lot. This can be tested in my Org notes, my phone notes, and also in my essays (by splitting paragraphs).</p>
<p>Another assertion is that, in essays, only major ideas have paragraphs to themselves. This is a powerful assertion - there can be no (or very few) paragraphs devoted to minor, irrelevant ideas.</p>
<p>Importance is proportional to size, I claimed. So, if we extract the ideas discussed in an essay, the most important ones should have a higher <em>fraction</em> of sentences or paragraphs devoted to them. Conversely, this probably won’t be the case in large outlines - there will be minor ideas taking up a lot of space.</p>
<p>“It is hard for minor ideas to buff up the size” - so, not only will it be uncommon to have large fractions of the essay to minor ideas, it will be <em>hard</em> to do so and still have a decent essay. That is, we have a strong pressure against having minor ideas.</p>
<p>Formats with lots of starts and ends will make you think you have lots of ideas, when in fact you don’t.</p>
<p>Because of paragraph length constraints, essays will be broken into logical paragraphs (A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; C =&gt; D, etc.) whereas outlines <em>won’t</em>.</p>
<p>Essays are <em>designed</em> to be read. Thus, they put pressure on having a single linear flow from premises to conclusions. There cannot be irrelevant ideas in the flow. In outlines, poor ideas can hide for long without being detected. They don’t have any real readers.</p>
<p>Another constraint is that there cannot be too many items in the linear flow in an essay. There are only so many things a human can keep in mind at a time (2-4 chunks, I am told). So, there is again pressure on the writer to keep things well-chunked and readable. Not so in an outline. You can have dozens of children for one outline heading, and dozens of further children of children. There is no pressure that way.</p>
<p>A tree has too many degrees of freedom. The 2-4 chunks theory provides a major constraint on essays. You cannot pass off a ten-item list as an essay. The difference comes about because the essay is designed to be read, the outline isn’t.</p>
<p>Corollary: The outline will be easier to write, but less useful. It has fewer degrees of freedom, and so you can add arbitrary notes at will. However, it will not serve your purpose as well as a tightly-constrained essay.</p>
<h2 id="further-hypotheses">Further hypotheses</h2>
<p>An essay is meant to be read; an outline isn’t. I believe this explains much of the differences we saw above.</p>
<p>If your essay doesn’t achieve the purpose of convincing a neutral smart reader, then you haven’t explained yourself well enough - and most probably haven’t understood it well enough either. Clear writing is clear thinking, as has been said.</p>
<p>Test: If we wrote an outline that was meant to be read, would that make it as good as an essay? Something that was chunked properly, without branching out too much at each level, and took you to a good understanding of the topic.</p>
<p>If not, what else still differs?</p>
<p>Is it the linearity? Perhaps outlines are hard to read - you need to jump from heading to heading, and that might tax your brain and prevent transfer of memory from WM to LTM.</p>
<p>Maybe outlines as a medium don’t force you to think deeply. Essays force you to make all your chunks explicit. You can’t just name-drop an idea and move to the next one. You have to spend a paragraph or so explaining exactly what it is and why it matters. It is in the explaining of such “obvious” ideas that, I think, we come up with new ideas. It is all too easy for us to feel we understand something when we don’t. Essays keep you honest.</p>
<p>Basically, there is very little ornamentation to get in the way of ideas. If you can’t deliver surprising ideas, the reader will notice. If you keep repeating yourself, the reader will notice. If your ideas aren’t clear, the reader will notice. In outlines, however, the form of all the headings and other structural elements might obscure the fact that you have nothing original to say.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>

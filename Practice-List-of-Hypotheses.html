<p><strong>Note</strong>: Many of the “hypotheses” here are poorly formulated. That’s the point. Fix them.</p>
<h1 id="hypotheses-test-them-for-causal-model">Hypotheses (test them for causal model)</h1>
<p>It is hypothesized that a forefoot strike pattern will correlate with lower ground reaction forces.</p>
<p>It is hypothesized that the structural and functional integrity of the system as a whole is dependent on nerve activity.</p>
<p>We aimed to test the hypothesis of whether young healthy women will increase muscle mass and lose fat mass after undergoing 12 wk of intense resistance training (Josse et al. 2010).</p>
<p>If food is present in the aquarium, then snails will move with greater speed (toward the food) (Green 2004).</p>
<p>Aspirin inhibits key oncogenic factors and/ or activates pivotal tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>If a plant receives fertilizer, then they will grow to be bigger than a plant that doesn t receive fertilizer.</p>
<p>Marsh grass growth is limited by available nitrogen (Miller and Levine 2010).</p>
<p>If the farmer burns the prairie then the next year will produce taller plants in his field then the previous year.</p>
<p>Based on this observation, we hypothesized that natural selection may have influenced AMY1 copy number in certain human populations (Perry et al. 2007).</p>
<p>The fire is replenishing the nutrients in the soil.</p>
<p>The foraging patterns of S. carpocapsae, as measured by directional response, are affected by electrical fields.</p>
<p>I believe resin content of various pine species will affect its energy output.</p>

<h1 id="pg-essay---why-smart-people-have-bad-ideas">PG Essay - Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas</h1>
<p>The first experiment is to sort applications into categories. Conventional hypotheses would expect there to be two categories: promising and unpromising. But, they found there to be another outcome: promising people with unpromising ideas. So, this is the first surprising piece of evidence.</p>
<p>The next question is obviously: why? What hypothesis would predict the outcome that several promising people would have unpromising ideas? Hence the title: Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas.</p>
<p>PG then talks about evidence from his past: “It’s very common for a group of founders to go through one lame idea before realizing that a startup has to make something people will pay for. In fact, we ourselves did.” So, there have been a lot of potentially promising founders who had bad ideas at some point. And the bad idea has the characteristic that nobody wants to pay for it. Paul Allen and Bill Gates also built an unsuccessful company at first.</p>
<p>The above evidence eliminates the hypothesis that promising founders will always pursue promising ideas. Wait. What do we mean by “promising founders” and “promising ideas”? Perhaps we use some criteria to choose a subset of all founders that has a high ratio of success. This may include things like intelligence as measured by IQ tests or standardized test scores, past projects, determination, and other indicators. What would “promising ideas” be? Maybe some subset of all possible ideas that people have used to build successful companies. Note that this does include ideas that may become successful in the future, since we don’t know what they are and would simply be guessing. So, promising ideas are determined by past successes. Or, maybe unpromising ideas are just those that nobody wants to pay for (though I don’t know how you would determine that right away; maybe you use heuristics like asking people point-blank and looking at existing products).</p>
<p>So, the above evidence shows that people who meet the “promising-ness” criteria (like PG, Bill Gates, etc.) commonly have ideas for products that nobody wants to pay for. That eliminates the hypothesis that promising founders will always, or even mostly, have promising ideas.</p>
<p>Hmmm… that’s not really a hypothesis at all. That’s just a prediction - smart people will have promising ideas. It doesn’t answer the question “why”. Why did we even assume in the first place that smart people (high IQ, determination, etc.) would have ideas for products that people would pay for? It’s like I expect some magic to happen - “Step 1: Be smart; Step 2: …; Step 3: Profit!”.</p>
<p>Anyway, even that ill-defined hypothesis is falsified. We cannot go with any hypothesis that predicts that smart people will have good ideas most of the time.</p>
<p>Next, we have the prediction that it’s only young people who get excited about bad ideas. Somehow, magically, older entrepreneurs will only have good ideas. (Note: there may have been survivorship bias here - in some other world, all the older founders with bad ideas might have been weeded out somehow; but that isn’t the case here.)</p>
<p>But, PG points out that he and his co-founder were excited a bad ideas even around the age of 30. Presumably other old founders have also made such mistakes. So, that rules out the magical “hypothesis” that says only young people have bad ideas.</p>
<p>So age doesn’t magically give you great ideas. Neither does smartness. So what does?</p>
<h2 id="still-life-effect">Still Life Effect</h2>
<p>One hypothesis he suggests is that we fall for the sunk cost fallacy. We fail to “garbage-collect” our ideas even after we realize that they are bad. We don’t change our minds despite strong evidence. Why not? He says that the idea for the company gets woven into our thoughts and we become unable to see it objectively. This might be the commitment and consistency effect, where we believe something is more valuable than it is because we behaved in the past as though it were valuable.</p>
<p>If this is so, then anybody who starts a company and invests time and money in it will be reluctant to drop it. This should be true independent of smartness or age (since the commitment and consistency effect gets us all). So, smart people shouldn’t be any more likely to stay with their initial company than non-smart people.</p>
<p>Also, this should apply to all kinds of behaviour, not just about dropping the company. As he says, founders would be reluctant to change their company name too. Or their co-founders.</p>
<p>And, it should be rare for founders to change the idea behind their company. But, what about the idea of “pivoting” or changing the company idea? That seems to be a well-known phenomenon. How come some founders do that (a lot)?</p>
<p>In other words, how can we predict a particular founder’s reluctance to change his idea? And, how do we predict when he will change his idea - within a month of realizing the problem? A year? What possible intervention could hasten the change? Will consulting with YC do the trick - will YC startups make more changes than others?</p>
<hr />
<p>Can unpromising founders (those who aren’t all that intelligent, determined, etc.) have promising ideas and build successful startups?</p>
<h1 id="ideas">Ideas</h1>
<p>Do you have a causal model? Do you answer “why” or do you just have a bunch of predictions without any cause?</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>Many of the hypotheses are from <a href="https://mrdrscienceteacher.wordpress.com/2014/11/02/teaching-the-hypothesis/">Dr Paul Strode’s blog post</a>. He sorted them into correct and incorrect. I’ve helpfully random-sorted them.</p>

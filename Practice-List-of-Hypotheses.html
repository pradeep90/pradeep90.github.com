<h1 id="pg-essay---why-smart-people-have-bad-ideas">PG Essay - Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas</h1>
<p>The first experiment is to sort applications into categories. Conventional hypotheses would expect there to be two categories: promising and unpromising. But, they found there to be another outcome: promising people with unpromising ideas. So, this is the first surprising piece of evidence.</p>
<p>The next question is obviously: why? What hypothesis would predict the outcome that several promising people would have unpromising ideas? Hence the title: Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas.</p>
<p>PG then talks about evidence from his past: “It’s very common for a group of founders to go through one lame idea before realizing that a startup has to make something people will pay for. In fact, we ourselves did.” So, there have been a lot of potentially promising founders who had bad ideas at some point. And the bad idea has the characteristic that nobody wants to pay for it. Paul Allen and Bill Gates also built an unsuccessful company at first.</p>
<p>The above evidence eliminates the hypothesis that promising founders will always pursue promising ideas. Wait. What do we mean by “promising founders” and “promising ideas”? Perhaps we use some criteria to choose a subset of all founders that has a high ratio of success. This may include things like intelligence as measured by IQ tests or standardized test scores, past projects, determination, and other indicators. What would “promising ideas” be? Maybe some subset of all possible ideas that people have used to build successful companies. Note that this does include ideas that may become successful in the future, since we don’t know what they are and would simply be guessing. So, promising ideas are determined by past successes. Or, maybe unpromising ideas are just those that nobody wants to pay for (though I don’t know how you would determine that right away; maybe you use heuristics like asking people point-blank and looking at existing products).</p>
<p>So, the above evidence shows that people who meet the “promising-ness” criteria (like PG, Bill Gates, etc.) commonly have ideas for products that nobody wants to pay for. That eliminates the hypothesis that promising founders will always, or even mostly, have promising ideas.</p>
<p>Hmmm… that’s not really a hypothesis at all. That’s just a prediction - smart people will have promising ideas. It doesn’t answer the question “why”. Why did we even assume in the first place that smart people (high IQ, determination, etc.) would have ideas for products that people would pay for? It’s like I expect some magic to happen - “Step 1: Be smart; Step 2: …; Step 3: Profit!”.</p>
<p>Anyway, even that ill-defined hypothesis is falsified. We cannot go with any hypothesis that predicts that smart people will have good ideas most of the time.</p>
<p>Next, we have the prediction that it’s only young people who get excited about bad ideas. Somehow, magically, older entrepreneurs will only have good ideas. (Note: there may have been survivorship bias here - in some other world, all the older founders with bad ideas might have been weeded out somehow; but that isn’t the case here.)</p>
<p>But, PG points out that he and his co-founder were excited a bad ideas even around the age of 30. Presumably other old founders have also made such mistakes. So, that rules out the magical “hypothesis” that says only young people have bad ideas.</p>
<p>So age doesn’t magically give you great ideas. Neither does smartness. So what does?</p>
<h2 id="still-life-effect">Still Life Effect</h2>
<p>One hypothesis he suggests is that we fall for the sunk cost fallacy. We fail to “garbage-collect” our ideas even after we realize that they are bad. We don’t change our minds despite strong evidence. Why not? He says that the idea for the company gets woven into our thoughts and we become unable to see it objectively. This might be the commitment and consistency effect, where we believe something is more valuable than it is because we behaved in the past as though it were valuable.</p>
<p>If this is so, then anybody who starts a company and invests time and money in it will be reluctant to drop it. This should be true independent of smartness or age (since the commitment and consistency effect gets us all). So, smart people shouldn’t be any more likely to stay with their initial company than non-smart people.</p>
<p>Also, this should apply to all kinds of behaviour, not just about dropping the company. As he says, founders would be reluctant to change their company name too. Or their co-founders.</p>
<p>And, it should be rare for founders to change the idea behind their company. But, what about the idea of “pivoting” or changing the company idea? That seems to be a well-known phenomenon. How come some founders do that (a lot)?</p>
<p>In other words, how can we predict a particular founder’s reluctance to change his idea? And, how do we predict when he will change his idea - within a month of realizing the problem? A year? What possible intervention could hasten the change? Will consulting with YC do the trick - will YC startups make more changes than others?</p>
<hr />
<p>Can unpromising founders (those who aren’t all that intelligent, determined, etc.) have promising ideas and build successful startups?</p>
<h1 id="pg-essay---how-not-to-die">PG Essay - How Not To Die</h1>
<p>Practice Aim: Notice hypotheses (causal models), possible states, outcomes, and predictions.</p>
<h2 id="causal-model">Causal Model</h2>
<p>Central question: how not to die. Why? Because the state where you don’t die is, by definition, a state where you get rich. “If you can just avoid dying, you get rich.”</p>
<p>“I realize this will sound naive, but maybe the linkage works in both directions. Maybe if you can arrange that we keep hearing from you, you won’t die.” Why? Because you will push yourself to make things happen, out of fear of embarrassment. There is fear of embarrassment in front of the YC guys; then, there’s also peer pressure.</p>
<p>What states lead to startup death? No runway left or a main founder bails. PG hypothesizes that both are caused by a state of demoralization. Further, he hypothesizes that running a startup can be demoralizing.</p>
<p>He predicts that being aware of this can help you lessen the demoralization.</p>
<p>Another way to become demoralized is to feel that what you’re doing isn’t working and then assume that you’ve failed and give up. He predicts that by iterating on feedback, you can get it to work.</p>
<p>So, you need to do something that works (and will let you scale) and also something that makes you feel motivated to keep working.</p>
<p>He says that if you do something else alongside the startup, you will die, because startups are very hard to do and need your full focus. Also, if you have an excuse to fall back on if your startup fails, then you won’t work as hard on the startup. Fear of embarrassment in front of people motivates you to work hard on a project (and people will judge you badly if you fail at your main occupation). Fear of public humiliation is a very strong motivator.</p>
<p>(Corollary: Don’t try to avoid this by saying that you’re not really trying to do something?? like how you do it when you say it’s just a side project?</p>
<p>If this hypothesis is true, then it’s obvious what you must do to make yourself more likely to succeed in your mission. Commit to it.)</p>
<p>Question: what about the negative aspects of it? What about the fear and shame? Won’t those affect your performance? Isn’t it better to work without shame? (games, etc.) Will you become risk-averse somehow? Will consequentialism help you act in spite of your fear?</p>
<p>Bad shit is always coming in a startup. Why, though? Because any path to millions does (in a fairly efficient economy)?</p>
<hr />
<p>What are some of the alternative hypotheses?</p>
<p>Question: Will this startup live or die?</p>
<p>Reason behind runway-ending and founder-bailing: demoralization or something else?</p>
<h2 id="experiments-aka-states-of-the-world">Experiments aka States of the world</h2>
<p>How many will succeed? What will happen to the rest? What does “success” mean?</p>
<p>What will happen if you just avoid dying for a long time? Wait. That seems like an experiment, but in reality it’s a succession of states. There’s no variable called “death” that has to remain off for a few years. But, still, if you somehow manage the world such that you don’t die, what else would happen? If you haven’t died, then that means, he says, you still have runway and you are still motivated to work on it. [???]</p>
<p>What happens when a startup dies? Do they die loudly?</p>
<p>A few months later, will this startup contact us?</p>
<p>If we send an email, will they respond or not?</p>
<p>What will happen if you arrange that we keep hearing from you?</p>
<p>YC dinner every week, how much will you get done (as compared to when it isn’t there)?</p>
<p>What will happen if you tell us you haven’t done anything since the last time we talked?</p>
<p>What will happen if you stay in touch with other YC startups?</p>
<p>What is the official cause of death for startups?</p>
<p>How frequently do founder-bailing and runway-ending happen together?</p>
<p>If a startup is working round the clock and pumping out new features, what will happen? Will it die?</p>
<p>How will it feel when you’re running a startups? Not demoralizing at all?</p>
<p>Why has PG never done another startup?</p>
<p>Did Google have moments when things looked hopeless?</p>
<p>What will happen when founders have heard several times that it’s going to feel terrible sometimes? Will they feel less terrible?</p>
<p>Do you sink and sink or is it a rollercoaster?</p>
<p>How common is it to feel that what you’re doing isn’t working?</p>
<p>How often do startups get it right the first time?</p>
<p>What commonly happens when you launch? How many people care?</p>
<p>What will happen if you’ve made something a few users love? What will happen to your morale?</p>
<p>When you have a core of fanatic users, what will you have to do next? Just grow that core incrementally?</p>
<p>What will happen if you say a sentence ending with “but we’re going to keep working on the startup”?</p>
<p>What happens when you get distracted?</p>
<p>What are founders more motivated by?</p>
<p>What will happen if you are not able to give up?</p>
<p>How much optimization power does it take to make millions of dollars?</p>
<p>What is coming in a startup?</p>
<p>What should you do when disaster strikes?</p>
<hr />
<p>So, what kinds of states are we deal with here?</p>
<h2 id="predictions">Predictions</h2>
<p>Prediction: he expects a third of the companies to succeed. Actually, as much as a half.</p>
<p>Why? Which ones will succeed? Why do you say 50%? Why not 40% or 60% or 22% or 95%?</p>
<p>Rephrasing of the same prediction: half of you are going to die. Basically, specifying details about the state - half will die; those founders will not become rich.</p>
<h2 id="outcomes-and-evidence">Outcomes and Evidence</h2>
<h1 id="ideas">Ideas</h1>
<p>Experiments: What are you uncertain about?</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>Many of the hypotheses are from <a href="https://mrdrscienceteacher.wordpress.com/2014/11/02/teaching-the-hypothesis/">Dr Paul Strode’s blog post</a>. He sorted them into correct and incorrect. I’ve helpfully random-sorted them.</p>

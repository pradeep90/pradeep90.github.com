<h1 id="how-to-make-myself-reread-my-notes">How to Make myself Reread my Notes?</h1>
<p>Over the last few years, I’ve been surfing the web for at least an hour a day, often a lot more, and writing copious notes that I <em>never</em> reread. All of this seems like a waste of time.</p>
<p>Clearly, the problem is that I am not rereading my notes. After all, I know for sure that there are gems of insights buried in my notes. How can I make myself read my notes more often and uncover those gems?</p>
<p>Maybe I should change the format of my notes, so that they are easier to search for. Maybe I should use some high-tech note-taking technique such as “transclusion”, which allows you to cross-reference notes from other files, kind of like citations in scientific papers. Linking my notes like that might make me reread old notes. Maybe I should publish more notes as essays, so that I would be forced to clean them up and would have a uniform web interface for accessing them.</p>
<p>If I just reread my notes more often, everything will turn out fine, right?</p>
<h1 id="asking-the-wrong-question-what-is-the-problem-youre-trying-to-solve">Asking the Wrong Question: What is the Problem you’re trying to solve?</h1>
<p>My goal is to solve problems, not to read books or write essays. Reading is just a way to get solutions from others to problems I can’t solve. Writing is just a way to create solutions that others haven’t found.</p>
<p>Lesson: Wait till you have a problem before you search for solutions (i.e., read or write).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am an old man and have known a great many troubles, but most of them have never happened.</p>
<p>– Mark Twain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 80/20 principle suggests that most notes will be useless, things you’ve written “just in case” they turn out to be useful in the distant future. Instead, if you wait till you actually have a problem, you are more likely to read and write about something that will actually help solve a problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Develop the habit of asking yourself, “Will I definitely use this information for something immediate and important?”</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s not enough to use information for “something” - it needs to be immediate and important. If “no” on either count, don’t consume it. Information is useless if it is not applied to something important or if you will forget it before you have a chance to apply it. …</p>
<p>Focus on what digerati Kathy Sierra calls “just-in-time” information instead of “just-in-case” information.</p>
<p>– Timothy Ferriss, The 4 Hour Work Week</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="exhaust-known-solutions-before-reaching-for-new-ones">Exhaust Known Solutions before Reaching for New Ones</h1>
<p>What if you do have a problem? Are you free to just drink from the firehose of information that we call the internet?</p>
<p>For example, I was feeling down last week. I wondered if the solution would be in some new technique, found in some shiny new book. I even looked online for a list of books that seemed relevant. But, before I went ahead, I decided to go over my existing techniques to see if I was missing something obvious. What had changed from the week before? Turns out that I hadn’t been to the gym in two weeks and hadn’t done any deep, focused work either. No wonder I was feeling miserable; I wasn’t making progress on any of my goals. This doesn’t mean, of course, that going to the gym and doing three hours of deep work would solve my problem. But I should at least eliminate known causes before jumping to the conclusion that my problem has some unknown cause.</p>
<p>Lesson: Exhaust known solutions before searching for something new.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you’re wasting time learning a new technique when you could be reusing a known technique. You’re also increasing the notes you have, meaning that you will read them less often.</p>
<h1 id="stick-to-a-word-limit">Stick to a Word Limit</h1>
<p>What if you have checked your notes and you don’t have a solution for your problem? If you’re going to read to find solutions by others, maybe set a time limit or a limit on the number of resources you check out. (Not sure about this.) To keep yourself honest, before you read something new, check that you have a problem and that you have exhausted known techniques.</p>
<p>If you’re going to take notes about what you’re reading, set yourself a word limit. That will prevent you from accumulating mountains of notes that you never read. That will also make it easier for you to find known solutions, or be sure that none exist, since you will have fewer words to search through. The same applies when writing in order to figure out a new solution for yourself. Don’t just accumulate a mound of ideas. Refine them to find the gems within.</p>
<p>What to do when your notes exceed your word limit? You will have to either discard the new note or replace an old note. Maybe keep count of the number of times each note has been used, so you can evict the note that has been least frequently used (or perhaps least recently used, as is done in computer caches). In other words, your writings form a cache, something that is faster to retrieve from than your usual storage, the way your pocket is faster to retrieve from than your backpack. Modern computers have given us essentially infinite storage, making us think we have an infinitely large pocket. But the more we dump in it, the longer it takes to find what we want, defeating its purpose. Treat your writing the way you treat your pocket - something small and fixed in size, which becomes unsightly when you stuff it with junk.</p>
<h1 id="appendix">Appendix</h1>
<p>Ideas I had while writing the essay:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ordering matters.</p></li>
<li><p>Additional supporting examples are mostly useless.</p></li>
<li><p>Short notes consulted often &gt; long notes never consulted.</p></li>
<li><p>Count number of uses of a note.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on notes you have used often.</p></li>
<li><p>Delete or archive notes you’ve never read. Avoid writing them in the first place.</p></li>
<li><p>Lesson: My problem statement was that my notes were unread. I should have focused on how to increase notes that were read and decrease notes that were not read. Instead of doing that, I meandered, talking about expected value of information and compression of raw data and word limit. The problem is the number of uses of my existing notes. Hug the problem statement.</p></li>
<li><p>Further lesson: My problem was that I was reading and writing instead of solving problems.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="outtakes">Outtakes</h1>
<h2 id="expected-value-of-information-how-could-this-change-your-decision">Expected Value of Information: How could this change your Decision?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If a measurement matters at all, it is because it must have some conceivable effect on decisions and behavior. If we can’t identify a decision that could be affected by a proposed measurement and how it could change those decisions, then the measurement simply has no value.</p>
<p>– Douglas W. Hubbard, How to Measure Anything</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Information matters to the extent it can change your decision. For example, if I’m about to head out and I notice on my phone’s weather forecast that it is going to rain in an hour, I will carry an umbrella. That weather forecast was valuable to my decision of carrying an umbrella. Of course, it may not always change my decision; a sunny forecast won’t change my plans. The point is that it has a track record of changing my decisions.</p>
<p>In economics, they call this the <em>expected value of information</em>. The information you get could be one way or another - the forecast could be rain or sun. If your decision will change in at least one of the possible scenarios, then the information is said to have positive expected value of information, calculated by the value you expect to save thanks to that information (i.e., not getting drenched because you carried an umbrella).</p>
<p>As another example, when I was booking flights recently, I didn’t read every detail of every flight. My mind was usually made up after a few seconds that I wouldn’t pick a flight, usually because it had multiple long layovers, cost twice as much as the other flights, or simply arrived in the middle of the night. It would have been a waste of time to keep reading about whether the flight was refundable or whether it had a change fee. That would not change my decision in any way.</p>
<p>The order of information also matters a lot. If I were forced to read about whether flights were refundable before I could check if they had long layovers, I would have wasted a lot of time reading about flights I would have passed on anyway.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with my notes?</p>
<h2 id="more-material-more-notes">More Material, More Notes?</h2>
<p>I have a million words in notes and rough essay drafts lying around my computer. I have practically never reread any of them. What was the point of all of those years of writing?</p>
<p>I used to think my notes need to grow along with my experiences. The more material I come across, the more data I see, the more notes I must have. Over the years, having read and analyzed lots of books, articles, and movies, I have ended up with tons of notes. Isn’t that good and natural?</p>
<h2 id="theory-usually-takes-a-few-words">Theory usually takes a Few Words</h2>
<p>Explaining a theory doesn’t take a lot of words. Most of the words are, I suspect, spent on walking through examples. This is true for a simple theory such as <code>a = F/m</code>, but is also true for the theory of supply and demand or the technique of test-driven development.</p>
<h2 id="rule-of-three-additional-supporting-examples-are-mostly-useless">Rule of Three: Additional Supporting Examples are Mostly Useless</h2>
<p>Additional examples of the same phenomenon usually have little expected value of information. For example, once you see an example of a decrease in supply leading to an increase in prices, more examples don’t tell you much. Writers generally limit themselves to three examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Drawing a line through one point is generally held to be dangerous. Two points make a dichotomy; you imagine them opposed to one another. But when you’ve got three different points - that’s when you’re forced to wake up and generalize.</p>
<p>– Eliezer Yudkowsky, <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/u9/my_naturalistic_awakening/">My Naturalistic Awakening</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means notes that pile on example after example are mostly useless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Isn’t it useful, though, to test your theory on examples?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, you may want to test your theory on examples. The question is when you should add it to your notes. If you find that your theory missed the mark, you will want to update your notes with that failing test and change your theory so it passes that test as well as all previously recorded tests. However, if it’s just another example of your theory working - they doubled the price of coffee and demand went down - there’s not much point in writing about it. You would have come to the same decision even without reading that note.</p>
<h2 id="short-notes-consulted-often-long-notes-never-consulted">Short Notes Consulted Often &gt; Long Notes Never Consulted</h2>
<p>A short piece of text that I consult often is better than a sprawling set of notes that I never consult. That way, my notes will actually have a chance of changing my decision. The short text will probably be imprecise and inaccurate. It may lead to suboptimal outcomes compared to the long notes, but a suboptimal outcome in hand is better than an optimal outcome in the bush.</p>
<p>I can’t afford to spend an hour reading through thousands of words each time I want to make a decision. And if I’m in a hurry, I have little chance of finding what I’m looking for in all those scattered notes. On the other hand, if I have a short canonical source of information, I would know that, if I have something relevant for my current scenario, it will be in that essay or book and nowhere else. And since it’s short, I will find relevant information quickly.</p>
<p>If I respect the word limit when updating my notes, then, over time, the value of information per word will keep going up. The word limit will force me to remove older, lower-value notes in favor of notes that have led to better decisions.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-measure-the-value-of-a-note">How to Measure the “Value” of a Note?</h2>
<p>How to measure the “usefulness” of notes? I’m going to go back to an essay I wrote eight years ago (and never applied):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the major Technique Traps is that we don’t actually apply the techniques we have. We just coast on the sugar-high of superiority. That stops right here.</p>
<p>I present to you the Greatest Invention in the History of Productivity:</p>
<p>(drumroll please)</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>… a simple Counter!</p>
<p>We will count - actually, empirically - how many times we have used a technique.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://pradeep90.github.io/The-Counter.html">The Humble Mr. Counter</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a note to be useful, you have to read it. [^point of writing] So, let’s measure how often we actually read each note.</p>
<p>[^point of writing]: Paul Graham has mentioned that even write-only notes can be useful because they change your thoughts:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; I write down things that surprise me in notebooks. I never actually get around to reading them and using what I've written, but I do tend to reproduce the same thoughts later. So the main value of notebooks may be what writing things down leaves in your head.
&gt;
&gt; -- [The Age of the Essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html)

That's fair, I suppose. But I'd like to get better results than this kind of unconscious, indirect effect.</code></pre>
<p>Use the counter on this essay itself. Don’t publish something unless you’ve actually used it once.</p>
<h2 id="should-i-delete-notes-i-never-read-should-i-not-even-avoid-writing-most-of-my-notes">Should I delete notes I never read? Should I not even avoid writing most of my notes?</h2>
<p>This is a prediction problem. Which notes am I going to reread in the future? My time and energy are limited. Let me invest my time on a few notes instead of betting indiscriminately on all kinds of notes. In other words, specialize.</p>

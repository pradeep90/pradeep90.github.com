<p>(This is a very rough essay. I present the bare skeletons of the ideas so that I can move forward with other ideas that build on them.)</p>
<h1 id="hypotheses">Hypotheses</h1>
<p>Assume you can identify variables in the environment. You can tell whether a switch is on or off, making this a binary variable. You can tell the length of an object using your measuring tools or even just mental judgment - that is a variable that takes a number as its value. There are many variables like these: length, time, colour, warmth, etc. You can even identify high-level variables, like “anger”. You can tell whether a friend is angry or not based on his facial expressions, words, and voice tone (all three of which are variables too). Anger is, in this simple model, a binary variable - he is either angry or he is not. Of course, you can have more complicated models, maybe where you judge his anger on a scale from 0-10.</p>
<p>So, you perceive variables all around you. And as you gain expertise, you can see variables where previously you saw none. Like, the genre of a song or the pitch of a singer, something that newbies can’t discern.</p>
<p>Now, how are these variables connected? Is it that anything goes? Can the variable “raining now” and the variable “as hot as the Sahara desert” be true at the same time? If not, why not? They’re just different variables. Why not let them be as they want? Live and let live, I say.</p>
<p>Variables are connected together. Of course, it needn’t be black and white. Maybe 99% of the time, it’s rainy and cool, but 1% of the time it’s rainy and hot.</p>
<p>That’s why you make a joint probability distribution over the variables. This table is the sum of all your knowledge. TODO: example, and what does it mean?</p>
<p>Now, you can’t have a JPD over all the variables in the world. Why not?</p>
<p>There are several hypotheses that fit that JPD. TODO: How many? Which one of them is correct? Which one can you use to make the best predictions?</p>
<p>Locality of causality factorizes your uncertainty. This assumption shrinks the hypothesis space to a great extent.</p>
<p>What do causal models look like?</p>
<p>What does this mean for your everyday problem-solving? Don’t humans already use causal models by nature? Where do we go wrong?</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>Designing and identifying “variables” is actually a big deal. But, we humans tend to do it reasonably well, or at least intuitively. So, let’s go with our native ability for now. I’ll delve into this in the future.</p>

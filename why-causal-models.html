<p>(This is a very rough essay. I present the bare skeletons of the ideas so that I can move forward with other ideas that build on them.)</p>
<h1 id="hypotheses">Hypotheses</h1>
<p>Assume you can identify variables in the environment. You can tell whether a switch is on or off, making this a binary variable. You can tell the length of an object using your measuring tools or even just mental judgment - that is a variable that takes a number as its value. There are many variables like these: length, time, colour, warmth, etc. You can even identify high-level variables, like “anger”. You can tell whether a friend is angry or not based on his facial expressions, words, and voice tone (all three of which are variables too). Anger is, in this simple model, a binary variable - he is either angry or he is not. Of course, you can have more complicated models, maybe where you judge his anger on a scale from 0-10.</p>
<p>So, you perceive variables all around you. And as you gain expertise, you can see variables where you previously saw none. Like, the genre of a song or the pitch of a singer, something that newbies can’t discern.</p>
<p>Now, how are these variables connected? Is it that anything goes? Can the variable “raining now” and the variable “as hot as the Sahara desert” be true at the same time? If not, why not? They’re just different variables. Why not let them be as they want? Live and let live, I say.</p>
<p>No. Variables are connected together. Of course, it needn’t be black and white. Maybe 19% of the time, it’s rainy and cool, and 1% of the time it’s rainy and hot.</p>
<h1 id="bingo">Bingo</h1>
<p>That’s why you make a Joint Probability Distribution (JPD) over the variables. This table is the sum of all your knowledge. It represents how much you expect one particular state to happen.</p>
<pre><code>| Rainy | Cool  | Probability |
|-----------------------------|
| False | False | 50%         |
| False | True  | 30%         |
| True  | False | 1%          |
| True  | True  | 19%         |

(The numbers are made-up)</code></pre>
<p>This model says that there’s this giant bingo machine that contains 4 types of balls in the ratio 50:30:1:19 (say, 100 balls with 50, 30, 1, and 19 of each type). It says that reality is the bingo host who picks one ball at random from the above and makes it the state of the world at some time. If it picks up one of the 50 balls of the first type, then it makes the world look (to you) like not Rainy and not Cool. If it picks up one of the 19 balls of the last type, then it makes the world look like Rainy and Cool.</p>
<p>Note that this model could be completely wrong. Maybe reality uses some other model where it produces Rainy and Cool with probability 34%, and so on. Your best guess was the model above.</p>
<p>Reality only picks one ball at a time. However, you don’t know for sure which one it is. So, you have to hedge your bets and say that it is 19% likely that it is Rainy and Cool. A perfectly knowledgeable guy would just say Rainy and Cool whenever reality picked Rainy and Cool and so on. But we aren’t perfectly knowledgeable.</p>
<p>So, you use your precious JPD to make predictions at every moment. If you check the world 100 times, on 19 occasions, you expect to see both Rainy and Cool. If you see them together 80 times, then that means your JPD was wrong. Thus, a JPD is very strongly falsifiable. It sticks its neck out and makes narrow predictions (19%, not 30% or 10%).</p>
<h1 id="the-catch">The Catch</h1>
<p>JPDs seem awesome. Why don’t we use those all the time? Well, here’s the problem. If you have just 10 binary variables, you get 2^10 = ~1000 possible combinations they can be in, just like the two binary variables above - rainy and cool - had 2^2 = 4 possible combinations. And the only constraint is that the sum of the probabilities of these combinations should add to 1.</p>
<p>Now, you can’t have a JPD over all the variables in the world. Why not?</p>
<p>There are several hypotheses that fit that JPD. TODO: How many? Which one of them is correct? Which one can you use to make the best predictions?</p>
<h1 id="simplifying-your-work">Simplifying your Work</h1>
<p>Instead of thinking that one thing can be caused by a hundred other things, near and far, you realize that it can only be directly caused by those that are near to it, in time and space. This is a massive simplifying insight.</p>
<p>Locality of causality factorizes your uncertainty. This assumption shrinks the hypothesis space to a great extent.</p>
<p>What do causal models look like?</p>
<p>What does this mean for your everyday problem-solving? Don’t humans already use causal models by nature? Where do we go wrong?</p>
<p>What are the immediate causes? Also, always ask why and how.</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>Designing and identifying “variables” is actually a big deal. But, we humans tend to do it reasonably well, or at least intuitively. So, let’s go with our native ability for now. I’ll delve into this in the future.</p>
<p>I learnt about causal models from Eliezer’s post <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ev3/causal_diagrams_and_causal_models/">Causal Diagrams and Causal models</a>.</p>
<p>I think a real-life JPD would include a variable for time too. So, if you wanted to know your predictions for different variables, you would marginalize over the time variable. But what about a perfect JPD? What is P(time = 7) or something? Is it 1/n?</p>

<p><strong>Key Question</strong>: What are the most valuable and surprising ideas I have?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="overall-aim">Overall Aim</h1>
<p>I want to figure out ways to think better and then tailor them for humans. I want to install these techniques in my brain. This, of course, involves testing my skills empirically. And I want to do all this quickly, for which I need more mental control (via motivation) and efficiency (via cognitive psychology). I also need to take uncomfortable actions, which requires that I have good boundaries and a strong sense of worthiness.</p>
<p>In short, I want to practice and research epistemic rationality at speed.</p>
<h1 id="most-valuable-ideas">Most Valuable Ideas</h1>
<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>
<p>Remember that these aren’t valid ideas unless you’ve published essays about them. Divide them into decoupled pieces and tackle them independently.</p>
<p>How to decouple them? Figure out your goals and ask if two parts might be used independently of each other. If so, separate them. For example, somebody can use the high-entropy advice without needing to know how to reduce information theory to probability theory.</p>
<p>Write them to answer the question: How can I use this idea to solve problems? Prioritize the most valuable ideas. Mere curiosities can wait.</p>
<p>Remember the fundamental rule: when stuck, use a concrete example! Take a concrete real-world information-processing problem - or even better, three - and show which of these “important” ideas you need. If you don’t need them, why are they on the list?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Causal models - understand them better; learn to use them everywhere. (Why I only look at the minute hand of the wall clock when judging time spans: because the hour doesn’t matter! It’s conditionally independent. Similarly, why I never bothered to remember concrete details - I felt they didn’t have any value of information. They wouldn’t change my decisions.)</p>
<p>Think of everything in terms of hypotheses and evidence. Specifically, think in terms of causal models. Aim to reduce all your problems to causal models, variables, and evidence.</p>
<p>Even more specifically, identify your variables. Then, look at their immediate causes and get evidence (correlations and interventions) to build some causal models. Then, look at their differing predictions to run good experiments and get the right causal model.</p>
<p>TODO: What are the conditions for something to be a variable?</p>
<p>Also, think about the difference between structure learning and parameter learning.</p>
<p>TODO: Later, bring in ideas from your journals.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: Defining categories is the major work in writing an essay (as in all human thinking). Coming up with good concrete examples (with lots of details) is the heavy lifting you have to do.</p>
<p>That is also why you have to write to a neutral smart reader, because then you’re forced to make your categories explicit and convey them, instead of assuming you just know them.</p>
<p>You can test this by looking at people’s essays and book chapters. Where do they spend much of the chapter? Could there be a good reason for that? At the end of the chapter, you can boil it down to a simple one-sentence causal model (poverty is what you want to attack, not economic inequality). But that’s only because you have learned the categories behind them (I theorize).</p>
<p>However, designing good abstractions and making the problem domain-independent is a huge deal too. It takes a while to peel off the jargon and get the problem to a simple model that even an outsider can understand.</p>
<p>Key question: How long does it take to learn a new category, of the sort that is in an essay or book chapter? You should be able to use it in your models comfortably, and recognize it in any situation (like supply vs demand).</p>
<p>Remember the skills of anticipation-constraints, etc. (from your journal notes).</p>
<p>Programmers worry about change because that defines the variables of interest. If the message string is going to change, then extract it into a variable of its own, so that the display function becomes decoupled from the message string.</p>
<p>Why are long functions bad? Because you could change any of the logic inside it. So what? Then, you would have to deal with a tangled mess and change a lot of the other parts. It’s hard to reason about such a function . In other words, you’re dealing with a raw JPD instead of factorizing it into orthogonal pieces.</p></li>
<li><p>Decoupling and abstractions</p>
<p>You can break a complex task into decoupled pieces and tackle them independently. Nobody writes a song by searching within the space of all possible word combinations. That’s just inefficient.</p>
<p>Look at your stack notes.</p>
<p>Talk about rapid prototyping and the need for good abstractions.</p></li>
<li><p>Value of Information - show that information is useless unless it can change your decisions; apply this to various everyday sources of “information”; The hypothesis that simple abstractions are possible.</p>
<p>What is the VoI of academic research?</p></li>
<li>Locality of causality - generate alternative hypotheses for this variable by permuting its direct causes.</li>
<li><p>Information and entropy - reduction to probability theory; look at things in terms of bits and learn quickly! Seek high entropy.</p>
<p>Remember conservation of expected evidence. Talk about when you win and when you change big.</p>
<p>Applications: for writing, convey only valuable surprises.</p>
<p>MCQs give you a ton of information by narrowing it down to just 4 options. That leaves a maximum of 2 bits of uncertainty. However, I suspect MCQs are bad (as retrieval tests) only when they fail to make you retrieve and just ask you to recognize the answer. The JEE questions forced you to retrieve plenty.</p></li>
<li><p>Categories - remember the three tasks of scientific thinking - design categories (in some format that scales to lots of domains), recognize them, and reason using them. This is how you get variables, I suspect. Design categories that have low entropy, somehow.</p>
<p>Why keeping your top ten problems or concepts in mind can help (as per Feynman): because you get to change your perception of problems. You pay selective attention to different details and thus form more informative categories, instead of just missing them totally.</p>
<p>Seeing with fresh eyes is (I suspect) nothing but paying selective attention to different things. When that girl in Pirsig’s story was trying to write about Bozeman, she was paying selective attention to nothing in particular and was coming up blank. But then, she started paying selective attention to one little brick… and suddenly there was no stopping her. She got a ton of information this way.</p>
<p>Why do concrete examples help break through thinking blocks? Because they make you pay selective attention to different things and thus build categories and actually move forward in your modelling. What happens when you don’t pay selective attention to different things? Why are you stuck then? Somehow your brain returns a total of zero solutions when you ask it (why?). For example, right now I’m asking my brain “why do you get stuck when you don’t pay selective attention to different things?” over and over again. But it doesn’t have an answer for that. So, I don’t make progress.</p>
<p>I think it’s because in that moment you don’t have enough evidence to chew on. Your mind can only work with evidence that is actually at the front of it (I think). Otherwise, it halts like a car out of fuel, even if you have a can of fuel in the trunk of your car. The fuel needs to actually be inside the engine for things to work. So, I guess using different categories (via selective attention on other features) lets you access memories that your mind can use as fuel.</p>
<hr />
<p>Your worldview changes after certain events, like before and after your first drink, cigarette, or lover. Before, you classify things using a black or white category - for example, “smokers are bad people”. But after you’ve done it yourself, you start to see a lot finer distinctions. Collect these kinds of worldview changes.</p>
<p>Have categories for consequentialist reasoning. You need to categorize things by their consequences, not by their random features. One of the diagnostic features should be: Is this valuable? Will it create different consequences?</p>
<p>Ask: what does a category forbid? How does it focus your uncertainty?</p>
<hr />
<p>Questions I still want to answer: How exactly do we categorize? What features do we use? How can we change those features? Who decides the diagnostic features for a category? Importantly, how many concepts can we learn in an hour?</p>
<p>Get prototypical examples for each important concept you have. Also, identify or design good diagnostic keys for those categories.</p>
<p>Going from a concept to concrete examples seems like a separate skill from the other way around. How can you improve your performance? Much of the difficulty in writing a publishable essay seems to be in getting good (or just any) concrete examples.</p></li>
<li>Relation between goals, queries, and abstraction levels; compile-time costs vs run-time costs; no fully-general models.</li>
<li><p>Need to design a step-by-step, start-to-end algorithm for learning, research, and problem-solving (using empirical examples).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="techniques">Techniques</h2>
<p>Only practice techniques that you’ve written essays about. I need to start using the above ideas on themselves. For example, decouple parts of my tasks, seek high-entropy experiments when figuring out what to do, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Empiricism and Naive realism - actually do stuff! #counter</p>
<p>Mainly, do something 25 times, not just once or twice! That’s what it means to actually apply it.</p>
<p>Fundamental question of rationality: What do you think you know and how do you think you know it? Make your claims explicit and ask whether you’ve given evidence to support them.</p>
<p>For example, when I saw Eliezer’s causal model post and thought that you could get Bayesian networks from the JPD and so we could all use causal models everywhere. But I didn’t know how to do that. I didn’t ask how you would get the JPDs (or how big they would be). And I didn’t ask how to get the Bayesian network from the JPD. Part of this was that I saw the exercise-overweight-internet example and thought that it should be doable. I didn’t probe the essay to see exactly what algorithm he used to get the conditional independence. The whole thing hinged on finding conditional independence and I didn’t know how to do that (mathematically)!</p>
<p>I trusted there would be some practical algorithm out there somewhere. I knew that AI people used Bayesian networks in several places, so it couldn’t be completely impractical. I think I made the right prediction. Eliezer and other high-profile researchers wouldn’t back this idea so much if it couldn’t be applied fruitfully.</p>
<p>The key message of the post - the biggest surprise - was that you could talk about cause and effect meaningfully using math (not just correlation, as was thought) and that you can infer causation from correlation (using certain assumptions). For the first claim, you could see that once you had a causal model, you could predict all kinds of things in line with our causal intuitions.</p>
<p>The second claim was where I fell down. I didn’t understand the subtlety or take it to its logical conclusion. Checking all the possible combinations for even a single conditional independence would be tiresome. The JPD is so damn big. And, most importantly, you don’t even have it in most cases - it really is too big. So, the claim is not that you can practically infer correlations from a JPD, it is that you can infer causation from <em>correlation</em> (using certain assumptions). Humans still have to notice and supply the correlation themselves (plus design the variables).</p>
<p>In short, the claim is that you can practically infer causation from correlation, not from JPDs.</p>
<p>I failed to notice the feeling of confusion when I worked on a concrete example. I didn’t realize that finding even a single conditional independence was beyond tedious. (Concrete examples rock once again, btw).</p></li>
<li>Taboo - (what informational work are you doing when you taboo?)</li>
<li>What are the alternative hypotheses (causal models)?</li>
<li>Look only at the differing predictions.</li>
<li>Think only in terms of causal models and evidence, or information. What are the immediate causes? Use this skill everywhere! Remember, locality of causality is a massive source of conditional independence!</li>
<li>What would falsify your hypothesis? (I think this opens a new category in our minds. Else, we’re always focussed on what it predicts, not what it forbids. They are duals of each other, sure, but our brain doesn’t see it that way.)</li>
<li><p>Start from the evidence. Don’t privilege any hypothesis.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="techniques-for-control-and-efficiency">Techniques for Control and Efficiency</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deliberate practice - actually apply those principles; do thousands of reps.</li>
<li>Boundaries and Worthiness (boundary for revise and refactor time. Maybe 15m everyday to refresh my memory on the important problems and make drills for things I forgot.); set deadlines - allot a certain number of days to a project.</li>
<li><p>Deep thinking - no distractions, full focus; Remember, I believe that you can solve any problem with deep thinking. (What are its limits, though?)</p>
<p>Most of the time, I don’t think deeply. What are the causes of deep thinking?</p>
<p>PG says, and I agree, that it takes at least an hour before you can come up with new insights. So, work in long, uninterrupted sessions.</p>
<p>Focus on one problem at a time. Solve it completely before you move on. This way you make visible progress and, most importantly, you force yourself to work harder.</p></li>
<li>Cognitive psychology - simplify, chunk, and always think in terms of <em>concrete</em> examples (remember what <code>2 + 2 = 4</code> did?). Plus categorization and deep thinking. Plus, sustainable hard work, repeated fresh attacks, and compounding of daily results over time. And spaced repetition.</li>
<li>Write essays - It’s not a real idea unless you’ve published an essay about it. So, my aim is to publish an essay about each of the concepts here.</li>
<li>Continuous Delivery</li>
<li>After-Action Report</li>
<li>Commentary for Causality and other resources</li>
<li><p>Motivation equation, willpower, gamification - satisfying work, fun failure, etc.</p>
<p>Design your tasks with the motivation equation in mind. Distinguish between satisfying work and problem-solving - you don’t have to work with completely unfamiliar problems all the time. Sometimes, you can do stuff that you know <em>how</em> to do.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading books and not surfing the web or watching videos (to build up linear, deep thinking - as opposed to scattered internet thinking)</p>
<p>Reading principle: Don’t highlight more than one phrase per page. Also, aim to breeze through the chapter once and write down your notes and then highlight phrases, etc. on the second pass (if there is one).</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to go from here</h1>
<p>Write essays about the important concepts above. Practice the techniques like hell. Test them empirically (and locally) - seek a lot of information about their worth. Also, implement techniques that boost your control and efficiency. Once you’ve explained your concepts so far, figure out better ones. Finally, decide the relative importance of these aspects and divide your time accordingly.</p>
<p>My six hours everyday belong to the above goals. I should do nothing else in that time. Take two hours for writing an essay everyday. Perhaps half an hour for implementing some principles and the rest of the time for practice.</p>
<h1 id="miscellaneous-concepts">Miscellaneous Concepts</h1>
<p>Prediction Book - apply information theory here - seek high entropy, etc. Look at the difference between calibration and discrimination. Also, what skill are you trying to practice? Predicting correctly in the heat of the moment, or just before you do something, or days before, or weeks in advance? Also test how your predictions are affected by evidence. Look at your old essay about making predictions effectively.</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>I need to organize my concepts well so that I can recall them easily.</p>
<p>In fact, I need to start with a simple structure and improve it over time.</p>
<h2 id="the-question-you-really-want">The question you really want</h2>
<p>The question I really want answered is: how do I split up my daily working time? That’s why I want to collect my ideas, so that I can spend time working on them. It doesn’t matter (here) whether I have a giant list of all my concepts. The only thing that matters is whether I spend my time on the right stuff.</p>
<p>Lesson: Don’t ask <em>what</em> you need to write; ask <em>why</em>. What will you do with it?</p>
<p>So, what stuff do I need to work on? Where will I get the most value?</p>
<p>I seem to know an ordering among my ideas but not on a relative scale; I can tell which ideas are more important than others but not how much more important they are. So, given that any idea needs a minimum time investment to pay off, the best I can do is to fit in ideas that are most valuable till I have no more time. Therefore, think about how much time you need to spend on the top ideas over the next one month and stop when the needed daily time exceeds my current budget (6 hours).</p>
<p>6 hours per day for the rest of this month makes for around 160 hours. How will you spend your next 160 hours?</p>
<hr />
<p>Actually, see through even the need to split up time. What I actually want to know is which essays to write (and thus which concepts to figure out), which techniques to practice, and which principles to implement. These are the three kinds of tasks I will do. The only questions are the order in which I will give them inputs and the proportions of these three tasks.</p>
<p>I need only specify 3-4 essay topics. The rest will follow naturally. Plus, I will collect, revise, and refactor my scattered ideas on a topic when I write an essay about it. So, no sweat.</p>
<p>Similarly, I need only practice 2-3 techniques right now. However, with principles, there’s no set limit. Still, it takes time to implement and tweak them based on the evidence. So, let’s restrict it to 3 principles.</p>
<h1 id="short-and-sweet">Short and Sweet</h1>
<p>Name your chunks well. I found that having one phrase to capture each of the three conditions for a Causal Bayesian Network helped me remember them effortlessly (“no screw, ideal, and narrow interventions”). I suspect this is a very powerful technique. Exploit it to remember everything important. Also, find out exactly how it works. Do you need to be able to say the chunk out loud within two seconds? How do we design the hierarchy of chunks?</p>
<h1 id="thirty-sseven-ruless">“Thirty-sseven Ruless”</h1>
<p>Make a prototype list of inviolable rules from important domains, like Professor Quirrell. Brain Rules, Your Brain at Work, etc. should help.</p>

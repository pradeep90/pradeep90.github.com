<p><strong>Key Question</strong>: What are the most valuable and surprising ideas I have?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="overall-aim">Overall Aim</h1>
<p>I want to practice and research epistemic rationality at speed. Let’s list the most important concepts for each of those aims.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>I want to figure out ways to think better and then tailor them for humans.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking is information-processing; use entropy to guide your thinking. Remember that conceptspace is superexponential.</li>
<li>Humans seem to use radial categories as the basis of their thinking. We can use these categories to form variables in our causal models. Good categories group things that have mutual information and thus reduce the message length needed to infer their common properties. Reducing the number of states, by abstraction, is one way of reducing the entropy. (TODO: stopped at Notes on Words)</li>
<li>Think only in terms of hypotheses and evidence (or causal models and information).</li>
<li>Exploit locality of causality.</li>
<li>Ask for empirical evidence, start from the evidence, and have at least three concrete examples for every concept</li>
<li>Write commentaries on important books and essays</li>
<li>I want to write out causal models for important fields. I thought that they were too complex for me to do that or even just read existing models. However, now that we know about domain-independent abstractions and simple words, perhaps it can be done.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="practice">Practice</h2>
<p>I want to install these techniques in my brain. This, of course, involves testing my skills empirically.</p>
<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>
<p>And I want to do all this quickly, for which I need more mental control (via motivation) and efficiency (via cognitive psychology). I also need to take uncomfortable actions, which requires that I have good boundaries and a strong sense of worthiness.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s not a real idea unless you’ve published an essay about it. So, my aim is to publish an essay about each of the concepts here.</li>
<li>Write an essay everyday.</li>
<li>Deliver continuously to get high quality and low cycle time in your projects</li>
<li>Set boundaries around things that are important to you. Allot them property rights over your time and resources. For example, set deadlines - allot a certain number of days to a project.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to go from here</h1>
<p>Write essays about the important concepts above. Practice the techniques like hell. Test them empirically (and locally) - seek a lot of information about their worth. Also, implement techniques that boost your control and efficiency. Once you’ve explained your concepts so far, figure out better ones. Finally, decide the relative importance of these aspects and divide your time accordingly.</p>
<p>Take the whole day tomorrow to fill this list of concepts and, after that, get to work.</p>
<p>How much time do I have? 4h15m.</p>
<p>What do I have to do? Make a list of ten concepts in each of those four categories along with their relative importance. Then, I need to divide my daily time among them.</p>
<p>What about the concepts that don’t fall into the top ten? I should write essays about them, even if I won’t use them any time soon. Do I list them all now? How much effort should I put into gathering them? Can I do them later? Well, only put as much effort as they’re worth. If you don’t have enough time for them, do them later. Right now, only collect ideas that you value a lot. (Delete them so that you know what’s left.)</p>
<p>TODO: Get ideas from your phone and journal notes. And also from your essays on variables and the scientific method. Also, look at the list below. For past boundaries (especially for fun and reading and prediction-making), look at your journal notes.</p>
<p>So, TODO for later: gather the remaining ideas and work them into essays if they’re important.</p>
<hr />
<p>Wait. I now realize that the question I really want answered is: how do I split up my daily working time?</p>
<p>That’s why I want to collect my ideas, so that I can spend time working on them. It doesn’t matter (here) whether I have a giant list of all my concepts. The only thing that matters is whether I spend my time on the right stuff.</p>
<p>Lesson: Don’t ask <em>what</em> you need to write; ask <em>why</em>. What will you do with it?</p>
<p>So, what stuff do I need to work on? Where will I get the most value?</p>
<p>I seem to know an ordering among my ideas but not on a relative scale; I can tell which ideas are more important than others but not how much more important they are. So, given that any idea needs a minimum time investment to pay off, the best I can do is to fit in ideas that are most valuable till I have no more time. Therefore, think about how much time you need to spend on the top ideas over the next one month and stop when the needed daily time exceeds my current budget (6 hours).</p>
<p>6 hours a day for the rest of this month makes for around 160 hours. How will you spend your next 160 hours?</p>
<h1 id="concepts">Concepts</h1>
<h2 id="how-to-think">How to think</h2>
<ul>
<li>Information-processing and probability theory</li>
<li>Causality</li>
<li>Empiricism</li>
<li>Game Theory and Decision Theory</li>
<li>Category Theory and Programming</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-max-your-brain">How to max your brain</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deliberate practice - focus on only one skill at a time, etc.</li>
<li>Cognitive science, especially categorization and deep thinking</li>
<li>Writing and Reading (to build up linear, deep thinking - as opposed to scattered internet thinking)</li>
<li>Mindfulness</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Gamification</li>
<li>Motivation</li>
<li>Willpower</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-to-do">What to do</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consequentialism</li>
<li>Long Thinking</li>
<li>Effective Altruism</li>
<li>Transhumanism (even just to expand your thinking)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mental-health">Mental Health</h2>
<ul>
<li>Worthiness and Boundaries</li>
<li>Philosophy (the Alain de Botton kind)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="individual-subjects">Individual Subjects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Economics</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>I need to organize my concepts well so that I can recall them easily.</p>
<p>In fact, I need to start with a simple structure and improve it over time.</p>
<h1 id="short-and-sweet">Short and Sweet</h1>
<p>Name your chunks well. I found that having one phrase to capture each of the three conditions for a Causal Bayesian Network helped me remember them effortlessly (“no screw, ideal, and narrow interventions”). I suspect this is a very powerful technique. Exploit it to remember everything important. Also, find out exactly how it works. Do you need to be able to say the chunk out loud within two seconds? How do we design the hierarchy of chunks?</p>
<h1 id="thirty-sseven-ruless">“Thirty-sseven Ruless”</h1>
<p>Make a prototype list of inviolable rules from important domains, like Professor Quirrell. Brain Rules, Your Brain at Work, etc. should help.</p>

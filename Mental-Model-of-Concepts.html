<p><strong>Key Question</strong>: What are the most valuable and surprising ideas I have?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="overall-aim">Overall Aim</h1>
<p>I want to figure out ways to think better and then tailor them for humans. I want to install these techniques in my brain. This, of course, involves testing my skills empirically. And I want to do all this quickly, for which I need more mental control (via motivation) and efficiency (via cognitive psychology). I also need to take uncomfortable actions, which requires that I have good boundaries and a strong sense of worthiness.</p>
<p>In short, I want to practice and research epistemic rationality at speed.</p>
<h1 id="most-valuable-ideas">Most Valuable Ideas</h1>
<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>
<p>Remember that these aren’t valid ideas unless you’ve published essays about them. Divide them into decoupled pieces and tackle them independently.</p>
<ul>
<li>Decoupling, abstractions, causal models - understand them better; learn to use them everywhere. (Why I only look at the minute hand of the wall clock when judging time spans: because the hour doesn’t matter! It’s conditionally independent. Similarly, why I never bothered to remember concrete details - I felt they didn’t have any value of information. They wouldn’t change my decisions.)</li>
<li>Information and entropy - reduction to probability theory; look at things in terms of bits and learn quickly!</li>
<li>Categories - remember the three tasks of scientific thinking - design categories (in some format that scales to lots of domains), recognize them, and reason using them. This is how you get variables, I suspect.</li>
<li>Relation between goals, queries, and abstraction levels; compile-time costs vs run-time costs; value of information; no fully-general models.</li>
<li>Locality of causality - generate alternative hypotheses for this variable by permuting its direct causes.</li>
<li>Need to design a step-by-step, start-to-end algorithm for learning, research, and problem-solving (using empirical examples).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="techniques">Techniques</h2>
<p>Only practice techniques that you’ve written essays about.</p>
<ul>
<li>Empiricism and Naive realism - actually do stuff! #counter</li>
<li>Taboo - (what informational work are you doing when you taboo?)</li>
<li>What are the alternative hypotheses (causal models)? What are their differing predictions?</li>
<li>Think only in terms of causal models and evidence, or information.</li>
<li>What would falsify your hypothesis? (I think this opens a new category in our minds. Else, we’re always focussed on what it predicts, not what it forbids. They are duals of each other, sure, but our brain doesn’t see it that way.)</li>
<li>Start from the evidence. Don’t privilege any hypothesis.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="techniques-for-control-and-efficiency">Techniques for Control and Efficiency</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deliberate practice - actually apply those principles; do thousands of reps.</li>
<li>Boundaries and Worthiness (boundary for revise and refactor time. Maybe 15m everyday to refresh my memory on the important problems and make drills for things I forgot.); set deadlines - allot a certain number of days to a project.</li>
<li>Deep thinking - no distractions, full focus;</li>
<li>Cognitive psychology - simplify, chunk, and always think in terms of <em>concrete</em> examples (remember what <code>2 + 2 = 4</code> did?). Plus categorization and deep thinking. Plus, sustainable hard work, repeated fresh attacks, and compounding of daily results over time. And spaced repetition.</li>
<li>Write essays - It’s not a real idea unless you’ve published an essay about it. So, my aim is to publish an essay about each of the concepts here.</li>
<li>Continuous Delivery</li>
<li>After-Action Report</li>
<li>Commentary for Causality and other resources</li>
<li>Reading books and not surfing the web or watching videos (to build up linear, deep thinking - as opposed to scattered internet thinking)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to go from here</h1>
<p>Write essays about the important concepts above. Practice the techniques like hell. Test them empirically (and locally) - seek a lot of information about their worth. Also, implement techniques that boost your control and efficiency. Once you’ve explained your concepts so far, figure out better ones. Finally, decide the relative importance of these aspects and divide your time accordingly.</p>
<p>My six hours everyday belong to the above goals. I should do nothing else in that time. Take two hours for writing an essay everyday. Perhaps half an hour for implementing some principles and the rest of the time for practice.</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>I need to organize my concepts well so that I can recall them easily.</p>
<p>In fact, I need to start with a simple structure and improve it over time.</p>
<h2 id="the-question-you-really-want">The question you really want</h2>
<p>The question I really want answered is: how do I split up my daily working time? That’s why I want to collect my ideas, so that I can spend time working on them. It doesn’t matter (here) whether I have a giant list of all my concepts. The only thing that matters is whether I spend my time on the right stuff.</p>
<p>Lesson: Don’t ask <em>what</em> you need to write; ask <em>why</em>. What will you do with it?</p>
<p>So, what stuff do I need to work on? Where will I get the most value?</p>
<p>I seem to know an ordering among my ideas but not on a relative scale; I can tell which ideas are more important than others but not how much more important they are. So, given that any idea needs a minimum time investment to pay off, the best I can do is to fit in ideas that are most valuable till I have no more time. Therefore, think about how much time you need to spend on the top ideas over the next one month and stop when the needed daily time exceeds my current budget (6 hours).</p>
<p>6 hours per day for the rest of this month makes for around 160 hours. How will you spend your next 160 hours?</p>
<hr />
<p>Actually, see through even the need to split up time. What I actually want to know is which essays to write (and thus which concepts to figure out), which techniques to practice, and which principles to implement. These are the three kinds of tasks I will do. The only questions are the order in which I will give them inputs and the proportions of these three tasks.</p>
<p>I need only specify 3-4 essay topics. The rest will follow naturally. Plus, I will collect, revise, and refactor my scattered ideas on a topic when I write an essay about it. So, no sweat.</p>
<p>Similarly, I need only practice 2-3 techniques right now. However, with principles, there’s no set limit. Still, it takes time to implement and tweak them based on the evidence. So, let’s restrict it to 3 principles.</p>
<h1 id="short-and-sweet">Short and Sweet</h1>
<p>Name your chunks well. I found that having one phrase to capture each of the three conditions for a Causal Bayesian Network helped me remember them effortlessly (“no screw, ideal, and narrow interventions”). I suspect this is a very powerful technique. Exploit it to remember everything important. Also, find out exactly how it works. Do you need to be able to say the chunk out loud within two seconds? How do we design the hierarchy of chunks?</p>
<h1 id="thirty-sseven-ruless">“Thirty-sseven Ruless”</h1>
<p>Make a prototype list of inviolable rules from important domains, like Professor Quirrell. Brain Rules, Your Brain at Work, etc. should help.</p>

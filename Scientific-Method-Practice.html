<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>I want to know how to describe a causal model. To that end, I’ll try to extract the causal models in ten PG essays and learn in the process.</p>
<h1 id="the-island-test">The Island Test</h1>
<p>An addict will imagine life without his drug to be intolerable.</p>
<p>Note that you may or may not actually feel empty without your drug. The test is about how you expect to feel.</p>
<p>That is a prediction. Why will you imagine so? Why don’t you think life will be epic?</p>
<p>Wait a minute. What do you mean by an “addict”? Make sure it’s not a self-serving definition. We can get a hint about what to expect from an addict by looking at a dictionary (Wordnet):</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>addict – (someone who is physiologically dependent on a substance; abrupt deprivation of the substance produces withdrawal symptoms)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah. Not everyone feels withdrawal symptoms when they are deprived of coffee (or music or whatever). This is a narrow prediction about the person. Add to that the notion that humans generally seek to relieve uncomfortable feelings. We can therefore predict that the addict will try to do whatever relieves uncomfortable feelings for him (which might even be the original drug). Further, we can use some research from psychology that says (citation needed) doing the activity won’t actually make you any happier. Finally, doing the activity a lot has high opportunity costs (money, health damage, time). Putting it together, you might conclude that it is not worth the cost and thus you probably don’t want to be addicted to it.</p>
<p>We can see several points along this chain of reasoning where we can test the model (and thus discover what we are addicted to). PG presents the Island Test as one such instrument.</p>
<p>Wait, now. Why does this above model predict that you will <em>expect</em> to be uncomfortable without your drug on the island?</p>
<h1 id="startup-investing-trends">Startup Investing Trends</h1>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/invtrend.html">essay</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One consequence of funding such a large number of startups is that we see trends early. And since fundraising is one of the main things we help startups with, we’re in a good position to notice trends in investing.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the most basic question: will the future be better or worse than the past? Will investors, in the aggregate, make more money or less?</p>
<p>There are two big forces driving change in startup funding: it’s becoming cheaper to start a startup, and startups are becoming a more normal thing to do.</p>
<p>That kind of change, from 2 paths to 3, is the sort of big social shift that only happens once every few generations. I think we’re still at the beginning of this one. It’s hard to predict how big a deal it will be. As big a deal as the Industrial Revolution? Maybe. Probably not. But it will be a big enough deal that it takes almost everyone by surprise, because those big social shifts always do.</p>
<p>One thing we can say for sure is that there will be a lot more startups. The monolithic, hierarchical companies of the mid 20th century are being replaced by networks of smaller companies. This process is not just something happening now in Silicon Valley. It started decades ago, and it’s happening as far afield as the car industry. It has a long way to run.</p>
<p>The other big driver of change is that startups are becoming cheaper to start. And in fact the two forces are related: the decreasing cost of starting a startup is one of the reasons startups are becoming a more normal thing to do.</p>
<p>There are still a lot of people who’d make great founders who never end up starting a company.</p>
<p>Mostly because of the increasing number of early failures, the startup business of the future won’t simply be the same shape, scaled up. What used to be an obelisk will become a pyramid. It will be a little wider at the top, but a lot wider at the bottom.</p>
<p>That opportunity for investors mostly means an opportunity for new investors, because the degree of risk an existing investor or firm is comfortable taking is one of the hardest things for them to change.</p>
<p>The traditions and financial models of the VC business were established when founders needed investors more.</p>
<p>You can’t fight market forces forever. Over the last decade we’ve seen the percentage of the company sold in series A rounds creep inexorably downward.</p>
<p>Venture capital is a business where occasional big successes generate hundredfold returns. How much confidence can you really have in financial models for something like that anyway?</p>
<p>If you want to find new opportunities for investing, look for things founders complain about. Founders are your customers, and the things they complain about are unsatisfied demand. I’ve given two examples of things founders complain about most - investors who take too long to make up their minds, and excessive dilution in series A rounds - so those are good places to look now. But the more general recipe is: do something founders want.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="before-the-startup">Before the Startup</h1>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/before.html">essay</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Startups are very counterintuitive. I’m not sure why. Maybe it’s just because knowledge about them hasn’t permeated our culture yet. But whatever the reason, starting a startup is a task where you can’t always trust your instincts.</p>
<p>The first item on it is the fact I already mentioned: that startups are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you’ll make a lot of mistakes.</p>
<p>Why do the founders ignore the partners’ advice? Well, that’s the thing about counterintuitive ideas: they contradict your intuitions. They seem wrong.</p>
<p>The second counterintuitive point is that it’s not that important to know a lot about startups. The way to succeed in a startup is not to be an expert on startups, but to be an expert on your users and the problem you’re solving for them.</p>
<p>The reason young founders go through the motions of starting a startup is because that’s what they’ve been trained to do for their whole lives up to that point.</p>
<p>It’s not surprising that after being trained for their whole lives to play such games, young founders’ first impulse on starting a startup is to try to figure out the tricks for winning at this new game.</p>
<p>Why do the founders always make things so complicated? The reason, I realized, is that they’re looking for the trick.</p>
<p>So this is the third counterintuitive thing to remember about startups: starting a startup is where gaming the system stops working.</p>
<p>There is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about is whether your product does what they want. Startups are as impersonal as physics. You have to make something people want, and you prosper only to the extent you do.</p>
<p>That brings us to our fourth counterintuitive point: startups are all-consuming. If you start a startup, it will take over your life to a degree you cannot imagine</p>
<p>Starting a successful startup is similar to having kids in that it’s like a button you push that changes your life irrevocably.</p>
<p>And it’s impossible to do that in college, for the reason I just explained: startups take over your life.</p>
<p>Do not start a startup in college. How to start a startup is just a subset of a bigger problem you’re trying to solve: how to have a good life.</p>
<p>I realize I’ve made startups sound pretty hard. If I haven’t, let me try again: starting a startup is really hard. What if it’s too hard? How can you tell if you’re up to this challenge?</p>
<p>The answer is the fifth counterintuitive point: you can’t tell. Your life so far may have given you some idea what your prospects might be if you tried to become a mathematician, or a professional football player. But unless you’ve had a very strange life you haven’t done much that was like being a startup founder. Starting a startup will change you a lot. So what you’re trying to estimate is not just what you are, but what you could grow into, and who can do that?</p>
<p>So if you want to start a startup one day, what should you do in college? There are only two things you need initially: an idea and cofounders. And the m.o. for getting both is the same. Which leads to our sixth and last counterintuitive point: that the way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas.</p>
<p>The best startups almost have to start as side projects, because great ideas tend to be such outliers that your conscious mind would reject them as ideas for companies.</p>
<p>Ok, so how do you turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in unconsciously? (1) Learn a lot about things that matter, then (2) work on problems that interest you (3) with people you like and respect. The third part, incidentally, is how you get cofounders at the same time as the idea.</p>
<p>I know how I know. Real problems are interesting, and I am self-indulgent in the sense that I always want to work on interesting things, even if no one else cares about them (in fact, especially if no one else cares about them), and find it very hard to make myself work on boring things, even if they’re supposed to be important.</p>
<p>So one guaranteed way to turn your mind into the type that has good startup ideas is to get yourself to the leading edge of some technology - to cause yourself, as Paul Buchheit put it, to “live in the future.” When you reach that point, ideas that will seem to other people uncannily prescient will seem obvious to you. You may not realize they’re startup ideas, but you’ll know they’re something that ought to exist.</p>
<p>If you want to start a startup after college, what you should do in college is learn powerful things.</p>
<p>The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain expertise. The way to become Larry Page was to become an expert on search. And the way to become an expert on search was to be driven by genuine curiosity, not some ulterior motive.</p>
<p>So here is the ultimate advice for young would-be startup founders, boiled down to two words: just learn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why do founders go through the motions of starting a startup? Because that’s what they have practiced doing for their whole life.</p>
<p>Why are startups so counter-intuitive? Well, why would you expect them to come easily? Have you been practicing this in your life?</p>
<p>What should you practice, then?</p>
<p>My hunch: consequentialism.</p>
<p>Why does gaming the system stop working in startups? Because your success is measured <em>completely</em> by how much your product meets people’s needs. You are forced to be absolutely consequentialist.</p>
<p>Why does it continue working elsewhere (in big companies, say)? Because there, your success isn’t measured by the quality of your work alone. There are other factors, hence you can use tricks to game the system if you’re smart enough.</p>
<p>Why is it hard to measure the quality of your work alone? Because your work is averaged with that of others. Remember, smallness = measurement.</p>
<p>However, I don’t think it is general-purpose consequentialism. It’s about consequentialism when it comes to making things that others want. Not for making things that will do something highly improbable but that nobody wants.</p>
<h1 id="why-there-arent-more-googles">Why There Aren’t More Googles</h1>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/googles.html">essay</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This has a nice sound to it, but it isn’t true. Google’s founders were willing to sell early on. They just wanted more than acquirers were willing to pay.</p>
<p>Tip for acquirers: when a startup turns you down, consider raising your offer, because there’s a good chance the outrageous price they want will later seem a bargain.</p>
<p>While I’m sure Larry and Sergey do want to change the world, at least now, the reason Google survived to become a big, independent company is the same reason Facebook has so far remained independent: acquirers underestimated them.</p>
<p>Corporate M&amp;A is a strange business in that respect. They consistently lose the best deals, because turning down reasonable offers is the most reliable test you could invent for whether a startup will make it big.</p>
<p>So what’s the real reason there aren’t more Googles? Curiously enough, it’s the same reason Google and Facebook have remained independent: money guys undervalue the most innovative startups.</p>
<p>The reason there aren’t more Googles is not that investors encourage innovative startups to sell out, but that they won’t even fund them.</p>
<p>Howard Aiken said “Don’t worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good, you’ll have to ram them down people’s throats.”</p>
<p>But it’s the bold ideas that generate the biggest returns. Any really good new idea will seem bad to most people; otherwise someone would already be doing it.</p>
<p>Why are VCs so conservative? It’s probably a combination of factors. The large size of their investments makes them conservative. Plus they’re investing other people’s money, which makes them worry they’ll get in trouble if they do something risky and it fails. Plus most of them are money guys rather than technical guys, so they don’t understand what the startups they’re investing in do.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to explain this to VC firms. Instead of making one $2 million investment, make five $400k investments. Would that mean sitting on too many boards? Don’t sit on their boards. Would that mean too much due diligence? Do less. If you’re investing at a tenth the valuation, you only have to be a tenth as sure.</p>
<p>Either VCs will evolve down into this gap or, more likely, new investors will appear to fill it. That will be a good thing when it happens, because these new investors will be compelled by the structure of the investments they make to be ten times bolder than present day VCs. And that will get us a lot more Googles. At least, as long as acquirers remain stupid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prediction: VCs undervalue (and don’t even fund) the most innovative startups.</p>
<p>Why? How do the innovative ideas look to most people? What about the VC’s mindsets?</p>
<p>What should we do?</p>
<p>But it’s the bold ideas that generate the biggest (monopoly) returns. Any really good new idea will seem bad to most people; otherwise someone would already be doing it.</p>
<h1 id="the-hundred-year-language">The Hundred-Year Language</h1>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html">essay</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that, like species, languages will form evolutionary trees, with dead-ends branching off all over. It’s because staying close to the main branches is a useful heuristic for finding languages that will be good to program in now. Convergence is more likely for languages partly because the space of possibilities is smaller, and partly because mutations are not random. Language designers deliberately incorporate ideas from other languages. In that case, “stay on a main branch” becomes more than a way to choose a good language. It becomes a heuristic for making the right decisions about language design.</p>
<p>Any programming language can be divided into two parts: some set of fundamental operators that play the role of axioms, and the rest of the language, which could in principle be written in terms of these fundamental operators.</p>
<p>I think the fundamental operators are the most important factor in a language’s long term survival. The rest you can change. It’s like the rule that in buying a house you should consider location first of all. Everything else you can fix later, but you can’t fix the location.</p>
<p>I think it’s important not just that the axioms be well chosen, but that there be few of them.</p>
<p>I have a hunch that the main branches of the evolutionary tree pass through the languages that have the smallest, cleanest cores. The more of a language you can write in itself, the better.</p>
<p>Languages evolve slowly because they’re not really technologies. Languages are notation. A program is a formal description of the problem you want a computer to solve for you. So the rate of evolution in programming languages is more like the rate of evolution in mathematical notation than, say, transportation or communications. Mathematical notation does evolve, but not with the giant leaps you see in technology.</p>
<p>As technologies improve, each generation can do things that the previous generation would have considered wasteful.</p>
<p>I can already tell you what’s going to happen to all those extra cycles that faster hardware is going to give us in the next hundred years. They’re nearly all going to be wasted.</p>
<p>If you have the resources, it’s more elegant to think of all phone calls as one kind of thing, no matter where the other person is.</p>
<p>There’s good waste, and bad waste. I’m interested in good waste– the kind where, by spending more, we can get simpler designs. How will we take advantage of the opportunities to waste cycles that we’ll get from new, faster hardware?</p>
<p>In language design, we should be consciously seeking out situations where we can trade efficiency for even the smallest increase in convenience.</p>
<p>Most data structures exist because of speed.</p>
<p>Saying less about implementation should also make programs more flexible. Specifications change while a program is being written, and this is not only inevitable, but desirable.</p>
<p>An essay, in the original sense, is something you write to try to figure something out. This happens in software too. I think some of the best programs were essays, in the sense that the authors didn’t know when they started exactly what they were trying to write.</p>
<p>Lisp hackers already know about the value of being flexible with data structures. We tend to write the first version of a program so that it does everything with lists. These initial versions can be so shockingly inefficient that it takes a conscious effort not to think about what they’re doing, just as, for me at least, eating a steak requires a conscious effort not to think where it came from.</p>
<p>What programmers in a hundred years will be looking for, most of all, is a language where you can throw together an unbelievably inefficient version 1 of a program with the least possible effort. At least, that’s how we’d describe it in present-day terms. What they’ll say is that they want a language that’s easy to program in.</p>
<p>Inefficient software isn’t gross. What’s gross is a language that makes programmers do needless work. Wasting programmer time is the true inefficiency, not wasting machine time. This will become ever more clear as computers get faster.</p>
<p>It’s like the hypothetical case of an irresistible force meeting an immovable object– here, an unimaginably inefficient implementation meeting unimaginably great resources. I don’t see why not. The future is pretty long. If there’s something we can do to decrease the number of axioms in the core language, that would seem to be the side to bet on as t approaches infinity.</p>
<p>Another way to burn up cycles is to have many layers of software between the application and the hardware. This too is a trend we see happening already: many recent languages are compiled into byte code. Bill Woods once told me that, as a rule of thumb, each layer of interpretation costs a factor of 10 in speed. This extra cost buys you flexibility.</p>
<p>Writing software as multiple layers is a powerful technique even within applications. Bottom-up programming means writing a program as a series of layers, each of which serves as a language for the one above. This approach tends to yield smaller, more flexible programs. It’s also the best route to that holy grail, reusability. A language is by definition reusable. The more of your application you can push down into a language for writing that type of application, the more of your software will be reusable.</p>
<p>As long as we’re talking about the future, we had better talk about parallel computation, because that’s where this idea seems to live. That is, no matter when you’re talking, parallel computation seems to be something that is going to happen in the future.</p>
<p>Except in special kinds of applications, parallelism won’t pervade the programs that are written in a hundred years. It would be premature optimization if it did.</p>
<p>How many programming languages will there be in a hundred years? There seem to be a huge number of new programming languages lately. Part of the reason is that faster hardware has allowed programmers to make different tradeoffs between speed and convenience, depending on the application. If this is a real trend, the hardware we’ll have in a hundred years should only increase it.</p>
<p>And yet there may be only a few widely-used languages in a hundred years. Part of the reason I say this is optimism: it seems that, if you did a really good job, you could make a language that was ideal for writing a slow version 1, and yet with the right optimization advice to the compiler, would also yield very fast code when necessary. So, since I’m optimistic, I’m going to predict that despite the huge gap they’ll have between acceptable and maximal efficiency, programmers in a hundred years will have languages that can span most of it.</p>
<p>As this gap widens, profilers will become increasingly important. Little attention is paid to profiling now. Many people still seem to believe that the way to get fast applications is to write compilers that generate fast code. As the gap between acceptable and maximal performance widens, it will become increasingly clear that the way to get fast applications is to have a good guide from one to the other.</p>
<p>Who will design the languages of the future? One of the most exciting trends in the last ten years has been the rise of open-source languages like Perl, Python, and Ruby. Language design is being taken over by hackers. The results so far are messy, but encouraging.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the distinction between acceptable and forbidden topics is usually based on how intellectual the work sounds when described in research papers, rather than how important it is for getting good results.</p>
<p>Though the situation is better in the sciences, the overlap between the kind of work you’re allowed to do and the kind of work that yields good languages is distressingly small. (Olin Shivers has grumbled eloquently about this.) For example, types seem to be an inexhaustible source of research papers, despite the fact that static typing seems to preclude true macros– without which, in my opinion, no language is worth using.</p>
<p>Unlike physics in a hundred years, which is almost necessarily impossible to predict, I think it may be possible in principle to design a language now that would appeal to users in a hundred years.</p>
<p>One way to design a language is to just write down the program you’d like to be able to write, regardless of whether there is a compiler that can translate it or hardware that can run it. When you do this you can assume unlimited resources. It seems like we ought to be able to imagine unlimited resources as well today as in a hundred years.</p>
<p>What program would one like to write? Whatever is least work. Except not quite: whatever would be least work if your ideas about programming weren’t already influenced by the languages you’re currently used to. Such influence can be so pervasive that it takes a great effort to overcome it. You’d think it would be obvious to creatures as lazy as us how to express a program with the least effort. In fact, our ideas about what’s possible tend to be so limited by whatever language we think in that easier formulations of programs seem very surprising. They’re something you have to discover, not something you naturally sink into.</p>
<p>One helpful trick here is to use the length of the program as an approximation for how much work it is to write.</p>
<p>Then the algorithm for language design becomes: look at a program and ask, is there any way to write this that’s shorter?</p>
<p>If we had the hundred-year language now, it would at least make a great pseudocode. What about using it to write software? Since the hundred-year language will need to generate fast code for some applications, presumably it could generate code efficient enough to run acceptably well on our hardware. We might have to give more optimization advice than users in a hundred years, but it still might be a net win.</p>
<p>Now we have two ideas that, if you combine them, suggest interesting possibilities: (1) the hundred-year language could, in principle, be designed today, and (2) such a language, if it existed, might be good to program in today. When you see these ideas laid out like that, it’s hard not to think, why not try writing the hundred-year language now?</p>
<p>When you’re working on language design, I think it is good to have such a target and to keep it consciously in mind. When you learn to drive, one of the principles they teach you is to align the car not by lining up the hood with the stripes painted on the road, but by aiming at some point in the distance. Even if all you care about is what happens in the next ten feet, this is the right answer. I think we can and should do the same thing with programming languages.</p>

<h1 id="ramen-profitable">Ramen Profitable</h1>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html">essay</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ramen profitable means a startup makes just enough to pay the founders’ living expenses. This is a different form of profitability than startups have traditionally aimed for. Traditional profitability means a big bet is finally paying off, whereas the main importance of ramen profitability is that it buys you time.</p>
<p>In the past, a startup would usually become profitable only after raising and spending quite a lot of money.</p>
<p>Ramen profitability is the other extreme: a startup that becomes profitable after 2 months, even though its revenues are only $3000 a month, because the only employees are a couple 25 year old founders who can live on practically nothing. Revenues of $3000 a month do not mean the company has succeeded. But it does share something with the one that’s profitable in the traditional way: they don’t need to raise money to survive.</p>
<p>Ramen profitability is an unfamiliar idea to most people because it only recently became feasible. It’s still not feasible for a lot of startups; it would not be for most biotech startups, for example; but it is for many software startups because they’re now so cheap. For many, the only real cost is the founders’ living expenses.</p>
<p>The main significance of this type of profitability is that you’re no longer at the mercy of investors. If you’re still losing money, then eventually you’ll either have to raise more or shut down. Once you’re ramen profitable this painful choice goes away. You can still raise money, but you don’t have to do it now.</p>
<p>The most obvious advantage of not needing money is that you can get better terms. If investors know you need money, they’ll sometimes take advantage of you. Some may even deliberately stall, because they know that as you run out of money you’ll become increasingly pliable.</p>
<p>But there are also three less obvious advantages of ramen profitability. One is that it makes you more attractive to investors. If you’re already profitable, on however small a scale, it shows that (a) you can get at least someone to pay you, (b) you’re serious about building things people want, and (c) you’re disciplined enough to keep expenses low.</p>
<p>This is reassuring to investors, because you’ve addressed three of their biggest worries. It’s common for them to fund companies that have smart founders and a big market, and yet still fail. When these companies fail, it’s usually because (a) people wouldn’t pay for what they made, e.g. because it was too hard to sell to them, or the market wasn’t ready yet, (b) the founders solved the wrong problem, instead of paying attention to what users needed, or (c) the company spent too much and burned through their funding before they started to make money. If you’re ramen profitable, you’re already avoiding these mistakes.</p>
<p>Another advantage of ramen profitability is that it’s good for morale. A company tends to feel rather theoretical when you first start it. It’s legally a company, but you feel like you’re lying when you call it one. When people start to pay you significant amounts, the company starts to feel real. And your own living expenses are the milestone you feel most, because at that point the future flips state. Now survival is the default, instead of dying.</p>
<p>A morale boost on that scale is very valuable in a startup, because the moral weight of running a startup is what makes it hard. Startups are still very rare. Why don’t more people do it? The financial risk? Plenty of 25 year olds save nothing anyway. The long hours? Plenty of people work just as long hours in regular jobs. What keeps people from starting startups is the fear of having so much responsibility. And this is not an irrational fear: it really is hard to bear. Anything that takes some of that weight off you will greatly increase your chances of surviving.</p>
<p>A startup that reaches ramen profitability may be more likely to succeed than not. Which is pretty exciting, considering the bimodal distribution of outcomes in startups: you either fail or make a lot of money.</p>
<p>The fourth advantage of ramen profitability is the least obvious but may be the most important. If you don’t need to raise money, you don’t have to interrupt working on the company to do it.</p>
<p>Raising money is terribly distracting. You’re lucky if your productivity is a third of what it was before. And it can last for months.</p>
<p>At any given time there tends to be one problem that’s the most urgent for a startup. This is what you think about as you fall asleep at night and when you take a shower in the morning. And when you start raising money, that becomes the problem you think about. You only take one shower in the morning, and if you’re thinking about investors during it, then you’re not thinking about the product.</p>
<p>Whereas if you can choose when you raise money, you can pick a time when you’re not in the middle of something else, and you can probably also insist that the round close fast. You may even be able to avoid having the round occupy your thoughts, if you don’t care whether it closes.</p>
<p>Few startups succeed without taking investment. Maybe as startups get cheaper it will become more common. On the other hand, the money is there, waiting to be invested. If startups need it less, they’ll be able to get it on better terms, which will make them more inclined to take it. That will tend to produce an equilibrium.</p>
<p>He believes you should get people to pay you from the beginning. I think that’s too constraining. Facebook didn’t, and they’ve done better than most startups. Making money right away was not only unnecessary for them, but probably would have been harmful. I do think Joe’s rule could be useful for many startups, though. When founders seem unfocused, I sometimes suggest they try to get customers to pay them for something, in the hope that this constraint will prod them into action.</p>
<p>The difference between Joe’s idea and ramen profitability is that a ramen profitable company doesn’t have to be making money the way it ultimately will. It just has to be making money.</p>
<p>Is there a downside to ramen profitability? Probably the biggest danger is that it might turn you into a consulting firm. Startups have to be product companies, in the sense of making a single thing that everyone uses. The defining quality of startups is that they grow fast, and consulting just can’t scale the way a product can.</p>
<p>It’s ok to do a little consulting-type work at first. Startups usually have to do something weird at first. But remember that ramen profitability is not the destination. A startup’s destination is to grow really big; ramen profitability is a trick for not dying en route.</p>

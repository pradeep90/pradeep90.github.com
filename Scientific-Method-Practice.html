<h1 id="dive-in">Dive in</h1>
<p>Taboo the term Scientific Method. What do I really want to do?</p>
<p>I want to increase the number of times I predict outcomes accurately. Let’s just try it out quickly and then correct ourselves. Which experiments do I care about predicting?</p>
<h1 id="skills">Skills</h1>
<p>Empiricism is one of the most important skills. I need to distinguish between the map and the territory and always seek empirical evidence. Next, I need to think in terms of anticipation-constraints instead of mere words. Then, I need to maintain hypotheses explicitly and update them on evidence. Lastly, I need to run hypothesis tests that distinguish well between my hypotheses.</p>
<p>Right now, I’m hitting a block because there seem to be so many things you can do (on the same sentence) and I don’t know where to start. Ok, Rapid Prototyping 101 - build a bare minimum hello world version. What can I not release without? I can deal with empiricism later. Anticipation-constraining is important, but right now I need something that will do work that cannot be replaced, a sine qua non if you will. What makes the scientific method the scientific method is the idea of differing predictions between hypotheses. Even the Bayesian updating on evidence can be done later. But testing things experimentally is the unique core of science, I think.</p>
<p>Ok. So, what can I test experimentally? What do I need to test experimentally? Well, what am I uncertain about? What can’t I explain and predict accurately right now?</p>
<h1 id="v1.0">v1.0</h1>
<p>One of my beliefs right now is that if we started thinking more scientifically, we would solve a lot more problems quickly. I need to drill down to the core of this and find out exactly when (or if) this is true, and how far scientific thinking can help me.</p>
<p>Let us look at the conventional hypothesis I’m trying to differ from. How else do people suggest you should think? Huh. Good question. Some might suggest going by your intuition, especially for informal subjects like friendship, values, mood swings, or relationships.</p>
<p>Ok, that’s our first differing prediction. My naive hypothesis says that we will be better off if we think scientifically and consciously at every step. One conventional hypothesis for informal topics says that you would fare better going with your gut.</p>
<p>First, what do you mean better off? Here, we care about predictive power, getting the right answer. However, that may not be our only aim as humans - we might want save face, or maintain good relations with others at the cost of a little truth, etc.</p>
<hr />
<p>No. Let’s talk about more widely important fields. Our professional lives, or important decisions that we take in life.</p>
<p>In the sciences, they mostly already use the scientific method. So, we have no difference there. Where do people not use the scientific method? In programming, for example. In businesses too, I believe. In the arts - writing, singing, composing, acting, etc. When people are designing things, I think they tend not to use the scientific method directly (this is a testable prediction).</p>
<p>So, my hypothesis is that the scientific method is great for figuring out the rules in a domain - why something behaves the way it does. Once you roughly know the rules, I think you tend to use a different kind of process to design things.</p>
<p>In programming, you know the core rules of your language. And now you want to build a program that satisfies certain criteria. Hmmm… the problem is you don’t really know the final program you want. You cannot visualize all the requirements in your head, they are too numerous. Plus, they keep changing over time. So, maybe what you’re uncertain about here isn’t the working of the language, it’s what you want to build and how you want to build it.</p>
<p>The same holds for other areas of design, I think. In writing, you may know the basic rules of grammar, but you’re unsure about what you really want to say and how you want to say it. Similarly for composing music or painting, I suppose.</p>
<p>In physics, chemistry, and the other sciences, the problem was that we humans were unsure about the rules of the domain itself. We didn’t know how exactly gravity worked, or which chemicals would combine to do what, or what each part of our body did. The main aim there was to discover the rules of the domain - the laws of physics, the properties of chemicals, the anatomy of the human body.</p>
<p>If the scientific method (or Bayesian thinking) is theoretically the most efficient way of getting correct knowledge about the world, why do we not use it when designing things? Is it because of our cognitive limitations? Or is the nature of the problem itself different from those in physics or chemistry? In short, is there a difference between reduction and creation?</p>
<p>I think we should use the Scientific Method no matter what we are uncertain about. It’s just that the thing we’re uncertain about changes. Perhaps we can use some approximations if our mind can’t handle the full-blown thing.</p>
<h1 id="lessons">Lessons</h1>
<p>Look at alternative hypotheses. You will be surprised by how often you can’t even think of one.</p>
<h1 id="other-ideas">Other ideas</h1>
<p>Essay-writing is one of the places where scientific thinking can help. I believe that if we wrote our essays in terms of hypotheses and empirical evidence that distinguished between them, then we would come to the correct answers more often, and more importantly not get waylaid by poor answers.</p>
<p>We routinely fail to notice what our beliefs forbid (if they do at all). That was the whole point of Eliezer’s sequence on Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions. Also, we avoid testing our beliefs. We like to stay comfortable. Then, we also fail to collect empirical evidence - we just go by our naive thoughts.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="ideas">Ideas</h1>
<p>Major attitude: everything has an explanation! Explain literally everything! Or, rather, anticipation-constrain literally everything! Figure out the cause behind everything. And, of course, when somebody claims that X is the cause, don’t accept it without evidence.</p>
<p>Don’t accept <em>anything</em> without evidence Somebody: “X is true” You: “So you say. Show me the evidence.”</p>
<p>A plan is based on a hypothesis (or, at least, on certain predictions) Successful plans are those that are based on correct hypotheses A plan is only as good as the hypothesis it is based on! Wait. Does this mean that a hypothesis drives a plan? Like, you could derive a plan from a hypothesis? And that, given one hypothesis, you can only have one possible (deterministic) plan? This would mean that choosing between plans is basically about choosing between hypotheses. i.e., Decision-making boils down to Truth-finding. But it always has! Remember, your Prediction Score determines <em>everything</em>! Corollary: Don’t ask which plan you should choose (among several), but rather, which hypothesis is true out of several. Ask not which plan would be most successful (out of several plans that achieve the same ends) Instead, ask what are the differing predictions between the hypotheses that those plans represent and see what the reality has been so far. Corollary: Don’t ask about the plan. Ask about the <em>hypothesis</em> it relies on. What are the assumptions it is based on? What does it expect will happen? Corollary: This implies you don’t just talk about <em>a</em> plan. You talk about multiple plans and choose between them. Remember, it’s meaningless to talk about just one hypothesis. Plans are programs. Hypotheses are programs.</p>
<p>Historical Perspective: Curiosity about how things came to be the way they are Why do we have supermarkets instead of ration shops? Why voting / democracy? Why civil service? Why parliament? These aren’t arbitrary facts. They are tightly governed by the true hypothesis about reality. They are superbly entangled. You shouldn’t be accepting it either way without question. “X happened? Oh, ok”. “X didn’t happen? Oh, ok.” – Wrong! Why does USA have Hollywood and why is it so popular around the world? It doesn’t have more people than Europe (I think)</p>
<p>Remember: Going into a new field (like Category Theory) is like going into the magical world. New rules to figure out and stuff. But the most important thing is that you’ve still got the experimental method, and that’s what matters.</p>
<p>At least one experiment everyday The Great Experiment Experiment</p>
<p>Maybe take on a project The difficulty I’m having could be because I’m looking for small one-off projects. Maybe the meat is in projects.</p>

<h1 id="ideas-for-scientific-method-domain-from-hpmor">Ideas for Scientific Method Domain (from HPMOR)</h1>
<p>If Y is an important subject, test out hypotheses about its various <em>properties</em> How much low-hanging fruit is left? How much power does this concept have? etc.</p>
<p>If you come across a new fact (aka some event + outcome), Anticipation-Constrain it against your theories Is it not possible? Raise huge alarms. Do your theories make any interesting inferences about it?</p>
<p>If you come across a new fact (event + outcome), update on that evidence</p>
<p>If you come across some strange or awesome thing, ask if you know its causal structure</p>
<p>If you see X doing Y, ask why did X do some action Y. (X could be you)</p>
<p>If you see X have a property Y, ask why. (X could be you)</p>
<p>If you see event Y happen to X, ask why. (X could be you)</p>
<p>If someone gives you a new hypothesis, ask for evidence. aka some program / causal structure to make predictions about certain events</p>
<p>If someone claims to have property X, test it out. (including yourself)</p>
<p>If you suspect Y exists, test it out.</p>
<p>You think you have learned technique Y. Test it out.</p>
<p>You think you have learned concept Y. Test it out.</p>
<p>If you want to make Y happen, come up with hypotheses.</p>
<p>Can Y happen? Check out the predictions of that hypothesis / Test it out.</p>
<p>In some new / confusing area, why doesn’t ~Y happen?</p>
<p>If you see some object Y, where does Y come from?</p>
<p>If you strongly believe Y is true, ask what would it take to convince you otherwise? Always be looking for ways to test your beliefs.</p>
<p>If you see X do some awesome thing Y, ask <em>how</em> does X do Y.</p>
<p>If you see some fact of the world Y, ask what caused Y to be like that. example: historical stuff like democracy, markets, etc.</p>

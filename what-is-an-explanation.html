            <!-- <center><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/t31.0-8/p600x600/10257116_10202295769100492_2438594605053717342_o.jpg" height="400" width="300" class="sujeet-pic" alt="Sujeet pic" /></center> -->

<h1 id="relevant-factors">Relevant Factors</h1>
<p>To explain a system is to come up with a model of how it produces some output. The first thing we need in a model is the set of factors that are relevant to the output.</p>
<p>For example, if we want to explain what causes a light bulb to glow, we have to mention that the electricity flow is a relevant factor. Otherwise, if we omit it from our model and the electricity happens to be off, we might flick on the light switch but find that the bulb doesn’t glow. Ditto for the wire connecting the bulb to the switch, the filament in the bulb, and of course the light switch itself. All of these can affect the output, namely the glowing of the bulb, and should be included in our model. We can, however, omit things like the color of the wire, the shape of the switch, and the name of the person flicking on the switch. These things don’t really affect our output variable as long as the relevant factors are present.</p>
<p>The relevant factors may hide some subtleties. If the filament is broken, the bulb may not glow even if all relevant factors are apparently present. So, there’s quite a bit hidden behind the phrase “filament in the bulb”. I won’t say that it has to be a “working filament”, since that’s a <a href="https://pradeep90.github.io/result-based-description.html">result-based description</a> that tells you nothing in advance, but bulb manufacturers know the necessary features. Similarly, there are some factors that we don’t even mention because they’re so common. I didn’t mention the very relevant factor of being outside water, without which the bulb won’t work despite all the electricity and wiring.</p>
<p>Finally, relevant factors just tell you which factors are important to the output, not how they affect the output. Even when the switch is turned off, the bulb may keep glowing for a few more seconds. All these details come under the model. Right now, we’re just looking at the inputs, not the model that produces the output from the inputs. Also, we are concerned with the simplified output variable of glowing vs not glowing. We don’t care about the exact brightness right now.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-claim-a-factor-is-relevant">How to Claim a Factor is Relevant?</h2>
<p>Hypothesis: If you want to claim some factor is relevant, you have to show it changing along with the output. This is necessary, not sufficient.</p>
<p>Next you have to show that other factors haven’t changed. So, the ideal is a controlled experiment. If you can’t have one, you can at least come up with a model that predicts the output based only on your relevant factors and thus makes the others irrelevant.</p>
<p>Since you always need a change in the output to show that something is a relevant factor, it’s a mistake to try to explain an absolute outcome. See the incest example.</p>
<p>Test: Polar bears have evolved their white color as means of camouflage. – page 47. What is the change in output? What makes you claim that past camouflaging success is a relevant factor for the white color? To do so, you need to show that when the color was not white, all else being equal, the bear had lower camouflaging success. Otherwise, it could be that it had had poor camouflaging success in the past because of its loud footsteps and that softer paws or whatever changed its success.</p>
<p>Note that this does not mean the white color is not relevant for camouflaging. If you kept the softer paws but made the bear black, maybe it would stand out from a mile away. All you can say is that the softness of the paws is relevant.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, one relevant factor for calling something a relevant factor is a change where it is toggled and the output is not. Show cases where something seems like a relevant factor but is not. For example, you may have thought that the color of the car contributed to its speed when in fact you would get the same speed despite changing it to any color you want.</p>
<p>One relevant factor for calling something an irrelevant factor, at least for that baseline, is to show it toggled to all different values while not affecting the output. For example, if you change the color of the car and find it doesn’t change the speed, you can safely call it irrelevant to the speed.</p>
<p>However the baseline is a relevant factor. When the engine is off, you can press the accelerator all you want and nothing will change. You might assume it’s irrelevant. But that’s only for the baseline of the engine being off. When the engine is on and you’re fourth gear, the accelerator will make a big difference. Another way of looking at it is that, if a necessary factor is missing, this relevant factor may not affect the output.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-relevant-factor">What is a Relevant Factor?</h2>
<p>If you change a relevant factor, then the output may change. The exact effect depends on the presence of other factors, such as the engine being on if you want the accelerator to have an effect.</p>
<p>If you change am irrelevant factor, then the output won’t change.</p>
<p>What is an explanation? At the very minimum, an explanation tells you the relevant factors for your output variable. A detailed explanation goes further by telling how exactly how the output depends on the inputs. It’s one thing to know that the accelerator will change your car’s speed; it’s another to know that pressing it for 15 seconds will make you go from 0 to 60 mph.</p>
<p>Corollary: Something without any relevant factors is not an explanation at all.</p>
<p>For example, semiconductor density has been doubling every 18 months. That’s because of Moore’s law. Not an explanation since it doesn’t point to any relevant factors such as the number of researchers in the field or the amount of money invested. It just states a pattern in the output over time. Time is not by itself a cause (?).</p>
<p>Similarly, societies without exception exert strong cultural sanctions against incest. – No relevant factors postulated. What is the change you’re explaining? You haven’t seen a culture without such a sanction.</p>
<p>He says that children of incest will have a higher risk of health problems. You still have to show how that causes a cultural sanction. Specifically, you have to show that when such a risk wasn’t present, the cultural sanction too wasn’t present.</p>
<hr />
<p>Is it enough to show that the output changes when your input factor changes? What about other factors that vary? Coming next.</p>
<h2 id="observable-variables">Observable Variables</h2>
<p>It’s key that your input and output variables be observable. This doesn’t mean that the inner variables don’t exist. Just because you can’t see the gears and carburettor of a car doesn’t mean they’re not there. It’s just that you start with your key in the ignition and your foot on the pedal and you end in the car’s movement.</p>
<p>For example, he’s phlegmatic because he has too much phlegm is ok, but it’s not testable. You can’t observe the phlegm and you don’t know any of its causes or even any correlates other than phlegmatism.</p>

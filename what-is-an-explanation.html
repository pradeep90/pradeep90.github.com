<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Suppose someone tells you that he can explain some phenomenon (TODO: example). When should you accept that he does? When should you reject it?</p>
<p>What does it mean to explain something? We say that a model explains the behaviour of a system on a given set of inputs if it produces the same outputs as the system for those inputs.</p>
<p>For example, suppose your friend says he can explain how a tap works. First, we need to know for which inputs he can explain the tap’s behaviour. Otherwise, he will need to answer all kinds of questions, such as what if I unscrew one part of the tap, break part of the nozzle, and use honey instead of water? Even if he wanted to predict just the rate of flow, he would need a lot of information. In fact, a model that tries to predict the entire output of a system for every possible input would have to replicate the system in its entirety.</p>
<p>So, we usually restrict ourselves to the cases where the system is changed only in a few ways, such as turning the nozzle of the tap, but not breaking part of it. Even for these restricted inputs, we usually don’t try to predict the entire output - such as the exact movement of every drop of water that leaves the tap. We accept a simplified output variable, such as the average rate of water flow or even something a simple yes-no variable like “is the water flowing?”.</p>
<p>Now, given this restricted set of inputs and the simplified output variables we care to predict, we need some way to produce the output from the input. The usual term for this is a program. A program is nothing but a causal model that allows us to predict the output given the input.</p>
<p>The simplest model (or program) might be one that just stores the system’s outputs for the desired set of inputs. For example, if you ask for the next day of the week after Saturday, your model can just store “Saturday -&gt; Sunday” and so on for the seven days. This is doable when the inputs and outputs fit in memory.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, we might try to predict the simplified output of the system for every possible input. This is what we call a simulation. For example, a driving simulator produces the output of changing car positions and scenery given the input of the car’s current location and the driver’s steering and pedal-pressing. It may omit parts of the output like exhaust fumes, precise shudders because of road bumps, or engine wear and tear.</p>
<p>If the system you’re modeling itself runs on a program, such as a chess-playing game, then that program is a sufficient model of the system. Of course, it’s no simpler than the system, but at least it will produce the same output for every conceivable input. If you want predict what the game will do for some input, you can try it out on your copy of the game. This works for physical systems as well. Safe-crackers practice on a copy of the safe they want to crack, hackers may figure out a hack on a copy of the device they want to break into, and apparently NASA scientists on Earth work on a replica of the machines on their space ships so that they can transmit to the astronauts whatever fixes they’ve discovered. In all these cases, you can trust that if some input works a particular way on your replica, it will probably work that way on the original.</p>
<h1 id="testing-an-explanation">Testing an Explanation</h1>
<p>One obvious way to test whether an explanation works for a system on a given set of inputs is to try all the inputs. That can be tedious, though, especially when there are millions of possible inputs. There are more efficient ways of testing - i.e., finding whether an explanation is wrong - and we will look at them later.</p>
<p>We will also look later at several fallacies in explanations that we can detect without even testing.</p>
<p>For now, let us look at things that purport to be explanations but really aren’t because they miss some factors.</p>
<p>Test:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Harry gasped for breath, “but what is going on?”</p>
<p>“Magic,” said Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>“That’s just a word! Even after you tell me that, I can’t make any new predictions! It’s exactly like saying ‘phlogiston’ or ‘elan vital’ or ‘emergence’ or ‘complexity’!”</p>
<p>– <a href="http://hpmor.com/chapter/6">Chapter 6: The Planning Fallacy, HPMOR</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does “Magic” meet our definition of an explanation? What was the system, what was the model, what was the simplified output variable, and what were the inputs? The system was the magical mokeskin pouch. Alright, but what was the model? “Magic” is not a program. It doesn’t allow you to take an input and return an output.</p>
<p>Does that mean nothing “magical” can ever be part of a model?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Wingardium Leviosa!” he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.</p>
<p>“You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. “It’s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and long.”</p>
<p>“You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Ron snarled.&quot;</p>
<p>– J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Funnily enough, this <strong>is</strong> a model (??). The system is that of a wand and a feather (and some unnamed inputs like the “magical power” of the person holding the wand). It says that if you wave the wand and say “Wingardium Leviosa” (with the right enunciation, of course), then the feather will levitate. If you fail to wave the wand or don’t say the words or don’t “make the ‘gar’ nice and long”, the feather won’t levitate.</p>
<p>Is this good enough? What about this unseen “magical ability”? How does your program account for that?</p>
<p>Well, to check if something is a model of a system for some inputs, you have to check if it recreates the same outputs. It seems to do so, and we will leave it there.</p>
<p>What is your output variable here? What <strong>doesn’t</strong> it cover? The exact height to which the feather levitates or the speed at which it does so. What if there is an obstacle?</p>
<p>Get a positive exemplar so that you can showcase all the mistakes using close negative exemplars. Obviously, the actual program itself is a sufficient positive exemplar (or an actual replica, if you’re dealing with a physical thing like a car).</p>

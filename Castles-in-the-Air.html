<h1 id="why-am-i-not-concrete-in-my-thinking">Why am I not concrete in my thinking?</h1>
<p>Why do I resist concrete practice activities? Why do I overwhelmingly seek abstract “research” over concrete practice?</p>
<p>Is it “because” of perfectionism? Why do I feel like I’m wasting my time if I choose a plan that is good but not optimal?</p>
<p>How many concrete projects have I really done in my life?</p>
<h1 id="learning-and-reasoning">Learning and Reasoning</h1>
<p>Concrete examples demand that you actually think, instead of hand-waving with vague concepts. And so they will lead to the best learning.</p>
<p>Plus, you have to actually build rich categories, instead of working with the deceptive fake-ideas in your mind.</p>
<p>Seriously, how can you say you know a category if you don’t have the exemplars that form it? Yes, perhaps you have its drawn-out logical definition (“a JPD is a table with probabilities for all possible configurations”), but that’s no use in practical thinking. You need to have example-based categories for fast reasoning (like a JPD for two variables and a JPD for 200 variables to know just how it looks in real life).</p>
<h1 id="answer-with-concrete-data-not-abstract-logic">Answer with concrete data, not abstract logic</h1>
<p>As far as possible, when you’re trying to figure out some problem, talk in terms of concrete examples. Don’t keep things abstract. Like, if you need to figure out exactly what a causal model is, take three causal models and then theorize. Don’t just make guesses out of thin air. Use empirical evidence to guide your thinking.</p>
<h1 id="advice-for-abstract-thinkers-think-depth-first-not-breadth-first">Advice for Abstract Thinkers: Think depth-first, not breadth-first</h1>
<p>Instead of flitting from topic to topic, pick one and go deep into it. Don’t move on until you’ve completely figured it out. This is how you’ve got your best rewards in the past.</p>
<p>However, you’re not going to feel like doing it. Be prepared for that. Push past the initial boredom. Do it even if it feels trivial; things will become challenging if you push deep enough.</p>
<p>A corollary is that there is no such thing as an un-challenging project. It depends on how deep you go into it. You can take the silliest work and push its limits till it practically merits a PhD thesis. (Hackers do this for everything they touch, I think, even if it looks silly and pointless from the outside.)</p>
<p>Remember the hacker deal: “you never have to work on boring projects, and in return, you’ll never allow yourself to do a half-assed job”. You get to work on cool, exciting stuff, but you have to hold yourself to a high standard.</p>

<p>Am I being concrete in my thinking here?</p>

<h1 id="explain-only-what-comes-afterwards">Explain only What Comes Afterwards</h1>
<p>Suppose someone claims that country X has a large deficit because of the new leader. You see that it does indeed have a butt load of money in deficit. So, he must be responsible, right? But how much of that is due to the new leader? First, he can’t be responsible (as a leader) for the deficit that occurred before he took office. And he may not be responsible for all of the deficit since he took office, because there may be non-discretionary spending, i.e., programs like welfare that he can’t cut down on. So, the maximum amount you can attribute to him is the change in deficit since he took office.</p>
<p>This makes it crucial to figure out the time at which some factor came into being and the change in output since then.</p>
<h1 id="the-cause-has-to-come-before-the-effect">The Cause has to Come Before the Effect</h1>
<p>Take another example. Suppose I say that cleaning the house made my clothes dirty. Is that a good explanation? First, we have to look at the change in dirtiness before and after the cleaning. Let’s say my clothes were white at the beginning and coated with dust by the end. Does that mean cleaning made my clothes dirty? Can I call it a relevant factor? Well, the problem is that both seem to happen simultaneously. It’s not like saying that a clean house will get a compliment from someone else. The house is clean at 4 pm and the compliment happens at 5 pm. There’s a clear separation in time; one comes before the other. But when I say that cleaning the house makes my clothes dirty, the house is being cleaned at 3:30 pm and my clothes are also being dirtied at 3:30 pm.</p>
<p>In short, how can I predict in advance - at 3 pm - that my clothes will be dirty at 4 pm? If I tell you that I’m going to clean the house later, that’s a sign that allows you to predict in advance what my clothes will look like at 4 pm.</p>
<p>When you give me a causal explanation, I want something now that will help me predict something that happens later.</p>
<p>Likewise, what if someone says that overpopulation causes illiteracy? Well, first, how much of a change are you explaining? How much more illiteracy is the additional population causing? The person making that claim may produce evidence (<strong>TODO</strong>) like “country A has low population density and low illiteracy; country B has high population density and high illiteracy”. You may rightly point out that that’s correlation, not causation. It’s a difference, but not a change. A difference is between two objects; a change is between the same object across time.</p>
<p>If you want to claim that more population density <strong>causes</strong> more illiteracy, you have to show that the population density goes from X to Y by the start of 2015 and the illiteracy rate goes up by a certain amount by the end of 2015.</p>
<p>Contrast this to a legitimate causal explanation, such as “being bitten by a female <em>Anopheles</em> mosquito causes malaria”. The mosquito bite comes today and the malaria comes ten days later. You can predict well in advance that someone is likely to get malaria. Of course, we’re assuming that you didn’t take any medicines in between and that you hadn’t had the vaccine before the mosquito bite.</p>
<p>Of course, things get a bit more complicated when the factor remains in force during the time period. Then, you have to look at the effect of high population density (in January 2015) and the effect of high population density (in May 2015). Clearly, if there has been a mass exodus, the result will change. Those are two <strong>different</strong> relevant factors! <span class="math inline">\(Density_{\text{January 2015}}\)</span> is different from <span class="math inline">\(Density_{\text{May 2015}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Wow. Notice how Eliezer’s idea of <span class="math inline">\(Eliezer_2001\)</span> is falling out naturally from my theory of causal explanations instead of being fitted on like an extra tool.</p>
<p>Also, if it is a continuously present cause, mention for how long it was present. Polluted air for three years is worse than polluted air for three weeks.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: If you say that the introduction of X caused Y to go from A at the start of 2015 to B at the end of 2015, then you must measure X <strong>at the start of</strong> 2015. If X happened in the middle of 2015, then it can only explain the change from that point to the end of the year.</p>
<p>Maybe you should predict an absolute outcome, not a change?</p>
<p>So, it’s not a valid causal explanation if someone says that, in 1820, population density in a particular country was X% and the illiteracy rate 88%, and that, in 2015, population density was Y% and the illiteracy rate 14%, and that therefore population density causes illiteracy. The cause has to come before the effect!</p>
<p>One way to do it right would be to look at the number of kids enrolled in school at the start of the school year of 2015.</p>
<h1 id="old-ideas">Old ideas</h1>
<p>Hypothesis: Thinking about the exact time at which some factor comes into effect is a relevant factor for attributing to it only the change since that time. Otherwise, you might attribute the entire output to that factor.</p>
<p>Not sure if it’s enough to think about the time when the input factor changed or whether you have to also look at the change in the output.</p>
<hr />
<p>The danger with explaining an absolute outcome, such as a certain number of riots or a certain GDP growth rate, is that you might attribute the entire outcome to whatever factor you see, when in fact it might be responsible for only a small change.</p>
<p>If the GDP growth rate has increased only by 0.5% since somebody took office, you can’t attribute the entire 5.6% growth rate to him. The same goes for other output variables like unemployment numbers, approval ratings, and trade deficits. A factor can be responsible only for the changes since it took effect; not the stuff that existed before it. So, we have to be careful to try to explain only a change, not an absolute outcome, lest we give someone too much credit or blame.</p>
<p>Around 14% of the adults in the world are <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/literacy">illiterate</a>. How do you explain that appalling number? You don’t. You don’t explain an absolute outcome because something that seems relevant, like high population density, may or may not be relevant after all. But if someone wants to know how the world went from 88% illiteracy in 1820 to 14% illiteracy in 2015, you can talk about that. This allows you to test whether a factor like population density was relevant. Did the density for a region change over that period? Or did it remain unchanged while the rate went up? Similarly, you don’t explain why 730 million people were under the poverty line in 2015. You explain why the world went from 1.9 billion people below the poverty line in 1990 to 730 million people in 2015.</p>
<p>In short, if you want to claim a relevant factor, you have to explain why something is <strong>poorer</strong>, not why it is <strong>poor</strong>. You have to explain why there is <strong>more</strong> literacy, not why there is an absolute level of literacy. Don’t ask what causes life. That feels hard to answer. Ask what causes the difference between life and death. Now I feel like I can think of some factors - such as not having enough oxygen and so on.</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>Look at an example of explaining too much. An arbitrary example: “You didn’t use a running example. I’m disappointed.” - how much of a change are you explaining? Is it that the total respect went to zero? Surely not. The person has done all kinds of other awesome things. But when you put it like “I’m disappointed”, it makes it look like the entire worth of that person is in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Ditto for “she rejected me; I’m a loser” - how much of a change are you explaining? What kinds of changes? Your bank balance is still as much as it was yesterday. Maybe you won’t be as fun to hang out with for the next couple of weeks, but it’s not like your entire life’s value is destroyed.</p>
<p>Test: California earthquake vs Indian earthquake - how much of the difference in lives lost is because of the earthquake-resistant building and how much due to the better emergency services?</p>
<p>Test: What about cases where cause and effect happen roughly at the same time, as when you get dirtied up when you clean the house? The problem was that you were trying to explain more than the observed change at each point.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: Look at notes from your practice.</p>

<h1 id="scientific-method-v1.0">Scientific Method v1.0</h1>
<p>Enough theorizing. Let’s put our ideas about the scientific method to the test. Let’s take a basic, inefficient version of the scientific method and see how far we can get with it.</p>
<p>I want to figure out how to extract the causal model from some resource. We can look at original research later. Right now, just obtaining a precise causal model will be good enough.</p>
<p>Here’s my v1.0 algorithm: Look at each paragraph and get the causal link. Essentially, take the first and last lines of each paragraph. Then, put all the causal links together into one model.</p>
<p>Mission: Use this on 30 paragraphs. (Edit: Didn’t do that many.)</p>
<p>Time: 1h30m</p>
<h1 id="what-doesnt-seem-like-work-by-paul-graham">What Doesn’t Seem Like Work by Paul Graham</h1>
<h2 id="raw-paragraph-summaries">Raw paragraph summaries</h2>
<p>Father is a mathematician?</p>
<p>He knew early on what he wanted to do.</p>
<p>It didn’t get boring when he was around 15. By then he was interested in maths.</p>
<p>What he really liked was solving problems.</p>
<p>Few people know so early or so certainly what they want to work on.</p>
<p>If something that seems like work to other people doesn’t seem like work to you, that’s something you’re well suited for.</p>
<p>The stranger your tastes seem to other people, the stronger evidence they probably are of what you should do.</p>
<p>It seemed curious that the same task could be painful to one person and pleasant to another, but I didn’t realize at the time what this imbalance implied, because I wasn’t looking for it.</p>
<p>So I bet it would help a lot of people to ask themselves about this explicitly. What seems like work to other people that doesn’t seem like work to you?</p>
<h2 id="causal-links">Causal Links</h2>
<p>Most people don’t know so early or so certainly. But PG’s father did.</p>
<p>(This is surprising evidence if you earlier had the causal link that “early in life -&gt; won’t know what you want to do”)</p>
<p>Most people get bored when they become around 15 and live in the country. PG’s father didn’t.</p>
<p>(Another piece of surprising evidence.)</p>
<p>PG (and most people) find textbook problems to be work. PG’s father found them to be a reward. And, most people don’t go on to become successful mathematicians; PG’s father did.</p>
<p>(Ditto. Basically, PG suspects a correlation between not finding something to be work and becoming successful at it.)</p>
<p>So, he says, if something that seems like work to others doesn’t seem like work to you, then you’re well suited for it.</p>
<p>(How?)</p>
<p>The stranger your tastes seem to other people, the stronger evidence they probably are of what you should do.</p>
<p>One task seems pleasant to one person and painful to another.</p>
<p>(Why?)</p>
<p>He wasn’t looking for it, so he didn’t realize what this imbalance implied.</p>
<p>Asking “what doesn’t seem like work for you” explicitly will help people. (How?)</p>
<h2 id="ask-why">Ask “why”</h2>
<p>Why don’t most people know early on? Why did PG’s father?</p>
<p>Why do most people become bored in the country at around 15? Why didn’t PG’s father?</p>
<p>Why do most people find textbook problems work? Why didn’t PG’s father?</p>
<p>if something that seems like work to others doesn’t seem like work to you, why would you be well suited to it?</p>
<p>I think he has observed evidence for the link that “if doesn’t seem like work, you will do it well; if it does, you probably won’t.” More importantly, he has the whole essay on “to do something well, you have to like it.” So, if you don’t like it, you probably won’t do it well (if you like it, you at least have a chance). (Why, though? Also, exactly how well will you do it if you like it?)</p>
<p>So, we need to find areas that you like.</p>
<p>Also, if very few people are good at it (as are you) and most people aren’t, then you will have a lot of scarcity power (assuming the skill is in demand).</p>
<p>So, if you want to have scarcity power, then you should be good at it and most people shouldn’t. Using the previous causal link, if we can find something you like and they don’t, then we get what we want. (There might be other ways of being good at something that most people aren’t, but this is sufficient.)</p>
<p>So, finally, if something seems like work to others but not to you, then you probably like it and they don’t. Therefore, you will probably end up with scarcity power in this field, and are thus well suited for it.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>If you (and very few others) are good at something and most people aren’t, then you will have a lot of scarcity power, assuming the skill is in demand.</p>
<p>To do something well, you have to like it (as per PG’s essay - How to Do What You Love). That is, if you don’t like something, you probably won’t do it well. If you do like it, you may do it well.</p>
<p>So, if you like something and most people don’t, then you will have scarcity power in that field. Liking something when others don’t will be a sufficient condition for scarcity power.</p>
<p>Finally, if you like something, you won’t find it to be work. if you don’t like it, you will find it to be work. So, whether you find it to be work or not is evidence for whether you like it or not.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you don’t find something to be work when others do, you will have scarcity power and thus will be well suited for it.</p>
<p>The main leap of inference in this essay was, I think, that being good at something when others aren’t translates into scarcity power. It isn’t enough just to be good, you have to be much better than others.</p>
<h2 id="causal-model">Causal Model</h2>
<p>you like something -&gt; won’t find it to be work</p>
<p>you like something -&gt; will probably do it well</p>
<p>you like X, most people don’t like X -&gt; you will probably be good at X, they won’t</p>
<p>you’re good at X, very few others are good at X -&gt; you have scarcity power</p>
<p>scarcity power -&gt; <span class="math">$$$</span></p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I got quite a few causal links from that essay. However, I wasn’t trying to be precise. For example, it’s quite vague as to “what seems like work” to a person and what doesn’t. Still, we have the essential structure of the model and it’s quite falsifiable right now.</p>
<h1 id="further-questions">Further Questions</h1>
<p>How do we represent complicated causes? Like, if A and B and not C, then D. I think we should use a variable X that combines A and B and not C, and talk about the values of D for the 8 possible states of X. However, not sure how the variables A, B, and C will cause different values of X.</p>
<p>Also, how do we decide the direction of causality? For example, how do we say whether it is that liking something makes it not feel like work or the other way round?</p>
<p>Mainly, I’m unsure about how to specify a causal link precisely. What is a necessary and sufficient condition to say that A causes B?</p>
<p>Next, what clear advantages are we getting by thinking using causes?</p>

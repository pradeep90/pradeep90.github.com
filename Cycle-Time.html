<p><strong>Entry Question</strong>: How do I reduce cycle times for products I care about?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="put-that-in-your-pipe">Put that in your pipe</h1>
<p>We want every action to have an impact. What is the point of hard work if you miss the target? Thus, we judge everything by its consequences. Not by the intentions, not by the worthiness of the actions, only the consequences. This is what we call Consequentialism. Or Rationality!</p>
<p>How do we avoid fruitless work in real life?</p>
<p>We want to optimize certain things in life. As terminal goals, we want to optimize our health, wealth, happiness, relationships, etc. To reach those goals, we have certain instrumental goals - get to a healthier body-fat level, create a successful company, practice various happiness habits, learn certain social skills, etc. We can think of these as Products.</p>
<p>There are several actions that can affect the final Products - the food we eat, the work we do, the skills we practice. We can think of these as Changes.</p>
<p>Here’s the nub: We want each Change to improve the Product somehow. Else, it is a pointless “Change”. However, several factors distort the flow. For one, we may <em>think</em> that the Change will improve the Product, but we may be wrong. Worse, the Change will actually improve the Product, but with a long delay (as with exercise and health) and so we may ditch it prematurely.</p>
<p>In short, we want each Change to <em>actually</em> cut through to the final Product and cut through fast.</p>
<h1 id="deployment-pipeline">Deployment Pipeline</h1>
<p>Enter this fascinating programming book called <a href>Continuous Delivery</a>. The authors suggest that the way to make each Change actually cut through is by automating the flow as much as possible. Ideally, the Product should start getting updated <em>whenever</em> you make a Change. More importantly, to cut through fast, we need to reduce the <em>cycle time</em> - the time it takes to go from making a Change to seeing an improvement in the Product.</p>
<p>In short, you have a Deployment Pipeline from Change to Product. You need to ensure that whenever you make a Change, the Pipeline quickly gets triggered and starts rebuilding the Product. You want to make sure you get high quality - that each Change really is reflected in the Product. Next, you want to minimize the cycle time - the time it takes for Changes to propagate through the Pipeline.</p>
<p>The question is now: how do we minimize cycle time and get high quality?</p>
<p>The answer from Continuous Delivery: Make frequent, automated releases and have visible feedback.</p>
<p>By making frequent releases, at each point, you make small changes and so you have lower risk. You always have the confidence of a working release behind you, and can experiment boldly. You get faster feedback about the Product and can “benefit from the most useful source of information available: the experience of implementing it”<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>. The more often you release, the more you get feedback and the more you can improve your Product.</p>
<p>By automating the release process, you have control over the way each Change affects the Product. Because computers work more reliably, you’re guaranteed that each step you take is fruitful and is actually having an impact.</p>
<p>Why do we need feedback? Because we don’t have an accurate model of reality. The model we have in our head is nowhere near as informative as the actual Product. We simply can’t consider all the variables and possibilities. You should be surprised if the final Product is <em>exactly</em> as you dreamed it would be.</p>
<p>So, design your feedback mechanism to tell you where you’re <em>wrong</em>. Feedback should change your path. If you aren’t where you want to be, you must change to get there.</p>
<h1 id="continuous-delivery-and-motivation">Continuous Delivery and Motivation</h1>
<p>Short cycle time leads to low delay. As per the Motivation Equation, you feel high motivation for actions with low delay. So, you will probably <em>only</em> do things for which you have low cycle time. (Examples? Counter-examples?) Conversely, you won’t do things that have high cycle time. This leads to a reinforcing feedback loop - they have high cycle time, so you don’t do them frequently, which leads to even higher cycle time (because things pile up) and so on, until it goes into oblivion.</p>
<p>Lower risk means you feel higher value. The Continuous Delivery authors mention that by releasing frequently you lower the risk of any new change. If anything goes wrong, you can always rollback to a working state. You can thus experiment with no downside. Actions that were earlier daunting now seem attractive.</p>
<p>Frequent releases give you higher expectancy. Because you want to release frequently, you work in small manageable increments. And since the previous state is known to work, you can code with confidence. This means that you have higher expectancy of success and thus feel more motivated.</p>
<p>So, having a snappy Deployment Pipeline with low cycle time and frequent releases will give us high motivation. We will do things we had put off earlier.</p>
<h1 id="putting-the-rapid-in-rapid-prototyping">Putting the Rapid in Rapid Prototyping</h1>
<p>Once you have Rapid Prototyping going, you implement features in the time you would have taken to add it to your to-do list. There’s just no waiting period. Got an idea? Implement it right away!</p>
<p>PG was right. Both about the fact that once you are able to implement your ideas, you start having more of them, and about the fact that you rarely have to maintain a formal to-do list. You just implement what you want. Having a working release gives you the confidence and ability to do that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What big companies do instead of implementing features is plan them. At Viaweb we sometimes ran into trouble on this account. Investors and analysts would ask us what we had planned for the future. The truthful answer would have been, we didn’t have any plans. We had general ideas about things we wanted to improve, but if we knew how we would have done it already. What were we going to do in the next six months? Whatever looked like the biggest win. I don’t know if I ever dared give this answer, but that was the truth. Plans are just another word for ideas on the shelf. When we thought of good ideas, we implemented them.</p>

<h1 id="forbid">Forbid</h1>
<p>Ok. What <em>can’t</em> a good Deployment Pipeline do?</p>
<p>Have you done frequent, automated releases of something and still failed to get what you want?</p>
<p>Open your eyes. You’ve had several things on your Dashboard for the past week or so. What came of it? You haven’t done much about your Git stats. Or your arbtt stats (consciously).</p>
<p>Your Dashboard is feedback. What has it made you <em>change</em>? You can maintain a count of how many times you changed because of the feedback.</p>
<p>Predict what you expect to see (no, not insane improvement) and check it against what actually happened.</p>
<p>Taboo the word Dashboard. What do you really expect to see? I expect that I will act immediately upon its feedback, that I will not let any warning stay there for more than a day. But, what happened? Well, I haven’t really taken too much action on the stuff there. I’ve ignored it’s warnings about the unstaged git changes or my time usage or about my practice hours. Worst of all, I’ve just gone and done whatever I wanted. The dashboard doesn’t write my bottom line, something else does.</p>
<p>What went wrong? Well, I don’t use the dashboard to decide what to do.</p>
<p>New prediction: If I make the dashboard useful enough and only use it to decide what to do, I will get things done.</p>
<p>In short, the feedback that the dashboard displays must be something you can actually affect. The shorter the cycle time the better, but it must be something you can affect directly.</p>
<h1 id="fundamental-questions-of-deployment">Fundamental Questions of Deployment</h1>
<p>How can we diagnose a Product we want to optimize?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When was your last release?</p></li>
<li><p>How frequently do you release?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you get feedback?</p></li>
<li><p>When did you last change your path because of feedback?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Simply aiming to minimize the cycle time may not be good enough. I procrastinate by saying that I will only work when the cycle time is super-short. That’s why you need to aim to release something, yesterday. Even if it is something crappy, you’re making progress. You can correct course with feedback.</p>
<hr />
<p>Let’s go through some of the important Products in my life and optimize their Deployment Pipelines.</p>
<h1 id="website">Website</h1>
<p>The Product here is a collection of surprising, informative essays on my website. My website should reflect the ideas in my head, and thus reflect their Changes. I get ideas by writing notes in my diary, Org files, phone (when I’m on the go), reading books (whether or not I make notes), and discussing with friends.</p>
<p>Now, I release my website every night through a script. So, I do in fact have frequent, automated releases here. However, the problem isn’t with releasing the essays I’ve written up inside my website directory. It’s with the ideas I haven’t written down, the drafts I haven’t cleaned up, and the old essays I haven’t updated yet. <em>That</em> is where my cycle time skyrockets.</p>
<p>When was the last time I released an idea from my diaries? A long time ago. I’m routinely surprised when I flip through the pages - I’ve forgotten much of it. Similarly, I can’t remember the last draft I turned into an essay, or the last essay I updated. Worst of all, I have this file called “Website-Notes.org” burgeoning with all kinds of “great” ideas. None of them have seen the light of day.</p>
<p>I need feedback about the ideas I haven’t implemented (perhaps by looking at the index of my diaries), about the number of drafts (should ideally be zero), and about essays that are out of date. I need to calculate some of them manually - for example, going through my essays regularly and seeing which ones need updating.</p>
<h2 id="delay-times">Delay Times?</h2>
<p>To reduce cycle time from idea to website, I have to eliminate my Org notes. Right now, they’re an intermediary, a buffer. Hence, a delay between an idea and its explanation. Maybe Next-Actions can stay. But everything else would have to go on the website.</p>
<p>Plus, now that we have nightly builds, we can just add stuff to the various Notes pages and get them reflected to the website automatically. No extra hassle. No more excuses. <strong>That’s</strong> what you get with automation!</p>
<p>Hmmm… One way to keep my Website synced with my Notes is to use <em>only</em> the Website as my View. No direct viewing of the notes files. That way, I lengthen the cycle time of mere “notes” lying around on my computer And shorten the cycle time of stuff that is part of my website.</p>
<p>No reading of Org notes. No reading of Diary notes. No reading of Phone notes. They are all just <em>inputs</em>, not outputs. The Model to my website’s View.</p>
<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Every time you change an Org notes file, create a Website notes page instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Website Notes - Avoid a “Notes” section. That’s just a loophole for disorganized crap.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1 id="writing-an-essay">Writing an Essay</h1>
<p>The Product here is a surprising and well-written essay. The ideas in my head are the Changes that can affect the final Product.</p>
<p>For each idea, I need to ask when I last released it. More generally, how frequently do I release it? I haven’t even released a bare-bones version of any of them. No wonder it’s daunting to think of adding them.</p>
<h1 id="rationality-techniques">Rationality Techniques</h1>
<p>Product: <em>Actually</em> benefiting from those techniques</p>
<p>Changes: Acquiring, Learning, and Applying them (as per the <a href="./The-Technique-Trap.html">Technique Trap</a>).</p>
<p>Feedback: How will I know that I have got the Product (i.e., benefited from the techniques)?</p>
<p>I need Feedback Mechanisms for those techniques. I don’t have these right now. However, the excellent book How to Measure Anything should help.</p>
<p>Cycle Time: How long does it take to actually start getting benefits from a technique?</p>
<p>Say I acquire a new technique or hear of a variation on an existing one. How long till I can start learning it? If I start learning a technique, how long till I can start to apply it? And if I start applying a technique, how long till I can see the results?</p>
<p>Concrete examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Empiricism - searching for empirical evidence to back or oppose some claim</li>
<li>Anticipation-Constraints - Asking what a theory forbids</li>
<li>Bayes Theorem - Generating hypotheses, looking at Differing Predictions, running hypothesis tests, and updating on evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>To reduce cycle time and get high quality, we need to have frequent, automated releases.</p>
<h2 id="empiricism">Empiricism</h2>
<p>What would it mean to have frequent, automated releases of the technique of Empiricism?</p>
<p>We need to release frequently to get quicker feedback and reduce the risk of new actions. If anything goes wrong, we can always rollback to a version that worked.</p>
<p>So, right now, I’m trying to be empirical in my essays. I plan to go through my old essays and add citations and such for the important assertions.</p>
<p>Ok. So, how do you know you’re really making progress, as opposed to just doing busywork? Why is it so important to be “empirical” in your essays? <em>How</em> does that produce value?</p>
<p>Taboo the word “Empiricism”. What do you really want to do more of?</p>
<p>Regarding beliefs, I want to believe <em>only</em> those things that are backed by evidence. I want to notice when I’m making unsupported claims. I want to be able to get quality empirical evidence, say by studying good textbooks or scientific papers.</p>
<p>Regarding techniques, I want to acquire <em>only</em> those techniques that are backed by solid empirical evidence. I want to purge my mind of techniques that don’t work but that I think they do. I also want to get rid of Affective Death Spirals about techniques - places where I believe something is an “Epic Awesome” technique when it is just an ordinary one.</p>
<p>Next, I want to <em>actually</em> learn the techniques using accurate instructions. I want to <em>actually</em> look at the instructions from an authoritative source instead of just going by my own impression. I need to enumerate the various scenarios for the particular technique, and build my skill in each of them.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to <em>actually</em> apply my techniques. A lot. I need to have empirical evidence saying that I have indeed applied so-and-so technique hundreds of times.</p>
<p>So, what is the Deployment Pipeline here? What are the changes and what are the products that must reflect those changes promptly?</p>
<p>For beliefs, the product is a belief with empirical evidence. Whenever I get a new belief or remember an unquestioned belief or come across new evidence, I need to update the product.</p>
<p>For acquiring techniques, the product is (the name of) a technique backed by empirical evidence. I need to update it whenever I get new evidence or come across new techniques.</p>
<p>For learning techniques, the product consists of the instructions, the Feedback Mechanism, the various scenarios the technique deals with, and lots of practice handling these scenarios using these instructions correctly as per the feedback. As each of those components changes, I need to change my routine. If my understanding of the instructions changes, or if I improve the Feedback Mechanism, or come up with different scenarios, I need to learn again - I need to practice with the new configuration. That is the <em>only</em> empirical way to know that I’ve learned the technique.</p>
<p>For applying techniques, the product is the benefit I get from the technique. I observe the benefit using a Feedback Mechanism. I need to apply each technique several times, maybe hundreds of times.</p>
<p>Cool. So, <em>that</em> is what Empiricism actually means to me.</p>
<p>For each of the above pipelines, we need to minimize the cycle time (reflect changes as soon as possible) and also get high quality (actually get the results). For that, the authors of Continuous Delivery recommend doing frequent, automated releases. Note that if I haven’t run the pipeline at all, the belief or technique has a cycle time of infinity. Bad.</p>
<p>Now, how do I create frequent, automated releases of the above pipelines?</p>
<p>At first, I need to get to Hello World - a Minimum Viable Product, if you will - and then take it from there. A belief with bare minimum empirical evidence; a technique with the same; a technique with simple instructions, a simple Feedback Mechanism, and one scenario. So, I will have a working pipeline for each of the above. From now, it’s a matter of iterating.</p>
<p>For beliefs, I need to accumulate evidence incrementally and update the product (belief + some empirical evidence). I need to do this nearly automatically after I come across new beliefs or evidence. Not quite sure how to do that. Maintaining a queue of beliefs and evidence might help. I can also forbid myself from using any beliefs other than the empirically-backed ones I’ve maintained on my website.</p>
<p>For acquiring techniques, I can do frequent releases by adding evidence incrementally.</p>
<p>For learning techniques, I can do frequent releases by keeping track of the components of each technique on my website. If one of them changes, say I discover some more scenarios for a technique, I can immediately practice handling them. To this end, I can maintain a <a href="./The-Counter.html">Counter</a> list of how many times I’ve practiced each scenario.</p>
<p>For applying techniques, I can again maintain a Counter for how many times I’ve applied a technique.</p>
<p>The common idea is that I need to reduce the cycle time by whatever means, and releasing frequently forces me to do so. I will start finding all kinds of ways to get it done. The key to making the pipeline nearly automatic might be to forbid myself from using a belief or technique unless I’ve updated it through the pipeline.</p>

<p>I need to release at least one version - i.e., wake up early once, by whatever means. After that, I can continue doing so more easily.</p>

<p><strong>Entry Question</strong>: How do I reduce cycle times for products I care about?</p>
<hr />
<p>Deployment Pipeline: What are my Products, Changes, Feedback, and Delay Times?</p>
<h1 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h1>
<p>Wow! Frequent releases are awesome for rapid development. I was able to make changes to my website I’d wanted to do for ages.</p>
<p>You know at each point that if something went wrong, it was your last change that did it. You <em>always</em> have the freedom to rollback to a working version. Immense freedom.</p>
<h1 id="website">Website</h1>
<p>Product: Surprising, Informative Essays on my Website</p>
<p>Changes: Making notes in</p>
<ul>
<li>Diary</li>
<li>Org</li>
<li>Phone</li>
<li>Reading Books (whether or not I make notes)</li>
<li>Discussions with friends</li>
</ul>
<p>Feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading the Website</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="delay-times">Delay Times?</h2>
<p>To reduce cycle time from idea to website, I have to eliminate my Org notes. Right now, they’re an intermediary. A buffer. Hence, a delay between an idea and its explanation. Maybe Next-Actions can stay. But everything else would have to go on the website.</p>
<p>Plus, now that we have nightly builds, we can just add stuff to the various Notes pages and get them reflected to the website automatically. No extra hassle. No more excuses. <strong>That’s</strong> what you get with automation!</p>
<p>Hmmm… One way to keep my Website synced with my Notes is to use <em>only</em> the Website as my View. No direct viewing of the notes files. That way, I lengthen the cycle time of mere “notes” lying around on my computer And shorten the cycle time of stuff that is part of my website.</p>
<p>No reading of Org notes. No reading of Diary notes. No reading of Phone notes. They are all just <em>inputs</em>, not outputs. The Model to my website’s View.</p>
<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Every time you change an Org notes file, create a Website notes page instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Website Notes - Avoid a “Notes” section. That’s just a loophole for disorganized crap.</p></li>

<p>Product: <em>Actually</em> benefiting from those techniques</p>
<p>Changes: Acquiring, Learning, and Applying them (as per the <a href="./The-Technique-Trap.html">Technique Trap</a>).</p>
<p>Feedback: How will I know that I have got the Product (i.e., benefited from the techniques)?</p>
<p>I need Feedback Mechanisms for those techniques. I don’t have these right now. However, the excellent book How to Measure Anything should help.</p>
<p>Cycle Time: How long does it take to actually start getting benefits from a technique?</p>
<p>Say I acquire a new technique or hear of a variation on an existing one. How long till I can start learning it? If I start learning a technique, how long till I can start to apply it? And if I start applying a technique, how long till I can see the results?</p>
<p>Concrete examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Empiricism - searching for empirical evidence to back or oppose some claim</li>
<li>Anticipation-Constraints - Asking what a theory forbids</li>
<li>Bayes Theorem - Generating hypotheses, looking at Differing Predictions, running hypothesis tests, and updating on evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>To reduce cycle time and get high quality, we need to have frequent, automated releases.</p>
<h2 id="empiricism">Empiricism</h2>
<p>What would it mean to have frequent, automated releases of the technique of Empiricism?</p>
<p>We need to release frequently to get quicker feedback and reduce the risk of new actions. If anything goes wrong, we can always rollback to a version that worked.</p>
<p>So, right now, I’m trying to be empirical in my essays. I plan to go through my old essays and add citations and such for the important assertions.</p>
<p>Ok. So, how do you know you’re really making progress, as opposed to just doing busywork? Why is it so important to be “empirical” in your essays? <em>How</em> does that produce value?</p>
<p>Taboo the word “Empiricism”. What do you really want to do more of?</p>
<p>Regarding beliefs, I want to believe <em>only</em> those things that are backed by evidence. I want to notice when I’m making unsupported claims. I want to be able to get quality empirical evidence, say by studying good textbooks or scientific papers.</p>
<p>Regarding techniques, I want to acquire <em>only</em> those techniques that are backed by solid empirical evidence. I want to purge my mind of techniques that don’t work but that I think they do. I also want to get rid of Affective Death Spirals about techniques - places where I believe something is an “Epic Awesome” technique when it is just an ordinary one.</p>
<p>Next, I want to <em>actually</em> learn the techniques using accurate instructions. I want to <em>actually</em> look at the instructions from an authoritative source instead of just going by my own impression. I need to enumerate the various scenarios for the particular technique, and build my skill in each of them.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to <em>actually</em> apply my techniques. A lot. I need to have empirical evidence saying that I have indeed applied so-and-so technique hundreds of times.</p>
<p>So, what is the Deployment Pipeline here? What are the changes and what are the products that must reflect those changes promptly?</p>
<p>For beliefs, the product is a belief with empirical evidence. Whenever I get a new belief or remember an unquestioned belief or come across new evidence, I need to update the product.</p>
<p>For acquiring techniques, the product is (the name of) a technique backed by empirical evidence. I need to update it whenever I get new evidence or come across new techniques.</p>
<p>For learning techniques, the product consists of the instructions, the Feedback Mechanism, the various scenarios the technique deals with, and lots of practice handling these scenarios using these instructions correctly as per the feedback. As each of those components changes, I need to change my routine. If my understanding of the instructions changes, or if I improve the Feedback Mechanism, or come up with different scenarios, I need to learn again - I need to practice with the new configuration. That is the <em>only</em> empirical way to know that I’ve learned the technique.</p>
<p>For applying techniques, the product is the benefit I get from the technique. I observe the benefit using a Feedback Mechanism. I need to apply each technique several times, maybe hundreds of times.</p>
<p>Cool. So, <em>that</em> is what Empiricism actually means to me.</p>
<p>For each of the above pipelines, we need to minimize the cycle time (reflect changes as soon as possible) and also get high quality (actually get the results). For that, the authors of Continuous Delivery recommend doing frequent, automated releases. Note that if I haven’t run the pipeline at all, the belief or technique has a cycle time of infinity. Bad.</p>
<p>Now, how do I create frequent, automated releases of the above pipelines?</p>
<p>At first, I need to get to Hello World - a Minimum Viable Product, if you will - and then take it from there. A belief with bare minimum empirical evidence; a technique with the same; a technique with simple instructions, a simple Feedback Mechanism, and one scenario. So, I will have a working pipeline for each of the above. From now, it’s a matter of iterating.</p>
<p>For beliefs, I need to accumulate evidence incrementally and update the product (belief + some empirical evidence). I need to do this nearly automatically after I come across new beliefs or evidence. Not quite sure how to do that. Maintaining a queue of beliefs and evidence might help. I can also forbid myself from using any beliefs other than the empirically-backed ones I’ve maintained on my website.</p>
<p>For acquiring techniques, I can do frequent releases by adding evidence incrementally.</p>
<p>For learning techniques, I can do frequent releases by keeping track of the components of each technique on my website. If one of them changes, say I discover some more scenarios for a technique, I can immediately practice handling them. To this end, I can maintain a <a href="./The-Counter.html">Counter</a> list of how many times I’ve practiced each scenario.</p>
<p>For applying techniques, I can again maintain a Counter for how many times I’ve applied a technique.</p>
<p>The common idea is that I need to reduce the cycle time by whatever means, and releasing frequently forces me to do so. I will start finding all kinds of ways to get it done. The key to making the pipeline nearly automatic might be to forbid myself from using a belief or technique unless I’ve updated it through the pipeline.</p>

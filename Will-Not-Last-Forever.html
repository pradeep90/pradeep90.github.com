<h1 id="harmful-belief">Harmful belief</h1>
<p>One of the most harmful beliefs is that our present experience will last forever.</p>
<p>We take things for granted. We far underestimate the rarity of our experiences. We don’t realize just how few times we will do a particular activity.</p>
<p>When it comes to bad experiences, we all know to tell each other that “this too shall pass”. We somehow fail to do that when it comes to good experiences.</p>
<p>I suspect that this is cause for much suffering when it comes to broken relationships and deceased friends.</p>
<p>How many times will you go to the movies with your parents? Pretty soon, they’re going to be too old to be doing that stuff with you, if they aren’t already. How many times will you chat endlessly with your friends? Pretty soon, you’re all going to be too busy to even be in the same city at the same time, if you aren’t already. &lt;insert other rare experiences here&gt;</p>
<p>As seekers of the truth, we need to be keenly aware of <em>exactly</em> how rare our experiences are. Not a vague idea of how the times are changing, or a faint feeling of malaise on a dull Sunday evening. We need to bring it front and centre in our lives.</p>
<h1 id="why-care">Why care?</h1>
<p>If we realize just how few times we might live a particular experience, we might cherish it even more. We may even change our priorities. After all, we generally ignore our dreams, family, feelings, friends, and happiness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The alarming thing is, the mistakes that produce these regrets are all errors of omission. You forget your dreams, ignore your family, suppress your feelings, neglect your friends, and forget to be happy. Errors of omission are a particularly dangerous type of mistake, because you make them by default.</p>
<p>– Paul Graham, <a href>The Top of My Todo List</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do we do instead? I think we get caught up in trying to live life successfully as per the current societal norms, which unhelpfully don’t promote these values. As PG said, we fall into the trap of becoming a cog, someone who fits in with society’s current demands. And those demands are pretty retarded, for the most part.</p>
<p>Why don’t we make the important things our top priorities? My hypothesis is that we don’t realize how rare and valuable these experiences are. We think we will do these after we have met some other requirements. First I’ll do this crap work, and <em>then</em> I’ll follow my dreams. Let me get well-settled and then I’ll spend a lot of time with my family. I’ll finish this godforsaken project done, and then I’ll pay attention to my feelings. Let me become successful and then I’ll spend time with my friends. Let me get everything done really well, and then I’ll remember to be happy.</p>
<p>A striking prediction of this hypothesis is that if someone does realize how rare and valuable these experiences are, they will focus significantly more on the above values and less on socially conditioned crap. No one can say my hypothesis is not falsifiable!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seize any opportunity, or anything that looks like opportunity. They are rare, much rarer than you think.</p>
<p>– Nassim Nicholas Taleb, <a href>The Black Swan</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taleb was talking about opportunities that could lead to a big break, but this maxim applies equally well to everyday joys. They really are much rarer than you think.</p>
<p>And remember, we won’t ever have magic moments that make up for years of misery. Life is not made up of great moments. It’s just made up on mundane everyday moments. Saying hi to a friend, smiling with your loved ones, teasing your siblings, watching your favourite sports team, doing a little bit more work on some project - this is the stuff life is made of, to paraphrase Ben Franklin.</p>
<p>I kept thinking that some extraordinary moments would make my life worth it, somehow. I still feel that way. But I’m wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we cannot take joy in the merely real, our lives shall be empty indeed.</p>
<p>– Eliezer Yudkowsky, <a href>Joy in the Merely Real</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="love">Love</h1>
<p>We overvalue romantic relationships, especially the ones we don’t even have yet.</p>

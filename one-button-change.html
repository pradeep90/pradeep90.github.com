<h1 id="one-change-at-a-time">One Change at a Time</h1>
<p>Hypothesis: We get evidence about our program by running it on some input or by type-checking it.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: We can process evidence about one variable at a time. Beyond that, we get confused.</p>
<p>(Yes, we can get lucky with multiple changes, but that won’t pay off on average.)</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: One key factor in programming efficiently - aka processing evidence about our program - is to make one high-level change at a time.</p>
<p>This means that you should be able to choose between your two design choices, say process scheduler A and process scheduler B with just one small change. No changing variable assignments in three different places, no tweaking of multiple configuration files - just one button press.</p>
<p>(Why would this weird condition help write programs faster? We’ll see.)</p>
<h1 id="how-to-program-with-one-button-changes">How to Program with One-Button Changes</h1>
<p>How will this affect your the way you code?</p>
<p>For one, you can’t change multiple lines of code within some other function. Because then, if you wanted to roll back those changes, you would have to edit multiple lines.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: Any change you make must be encapsulated within a function.</p>
<p>Now, what if you wanted to switch from scheduler A to scheduler B? Sure, A is within a function that you can comment (or in a class method that you can change at runtime via polymorphism). But B could be a bunch of lines of code strewn across your project. So, to switch to B, you would have to uncomment all those lines. Not allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: Any alternatives must be easily switchable.</p>
<p>In OOP, you would do this via interfaces or inheritance, where you simply switch the class that is implementing the interface, and the caller code is none the wiser. In functional programming, you simply switch to another value of the same type or type class.</p>
<p>What happens when you’re starting out with a new feature, like pipes in an operating system (completely hypothetical example; not related to my coursework at all)? If you press the button, you will switch to your neatly encapsulated function or class that implements pipes. But what if you want to go back to a pipe-less operating system, just to check for correctness or performance? You may not be able to, if you have pipe initialization and destruction code lying around, and if processes have information about pipes they may own.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: You must have a default alternative for every choice.</p>
<p>For example, if you implemented pipes, your default would be the non-piped version. (Again, you should be able to switch between these two in one button-press.) If you implemented a new time-share scheduler for the operating system, you must encapsulate the original scheduler as a default alternative.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you’re setting out on a “complex” change, you should have a default stub of it that does nothing.</p>
<h1 id="upshot">Upshot</h1>
<p>What do all those straitjackets get you? I’m not fully sure. We’ll find out the usual way: good ol’ fashioned experimentation.</p>
<p>Question: Why, if at all, would this lead to functions with minimal interfaces?</p>

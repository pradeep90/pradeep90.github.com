<h1 id="what-are-variables">What are variables?</h1>
<p>How do you create a variable?</p>
<p>Concrete examples.</p>
<p>Solve this and everything else will fall into place, I think.</p>
<p>I’m not saying it will be a cakewalk from here, but one way or another you will learn the true limits of the scientific method.</p>
<h1 id="how-do-programmers-deal-with-change">How do programmers deal with change?</h1>
<p>They look for hot spots - parts that can change - and then encapsulate the change to minimize the work needed to change it. For example, you’re printing five variables into a report. You know that you may change whether the fourth and fifth variable occur. So, you will either have the first three or you will have all five, rarely anything else. Now, given that we want one-button changes, the best way to go forward is to encapsulate the fourth and fifth variables into one variable and allow yourself to toggle them with just one change.</p>
<p>In short, you want to handle the most changes with the least effort. The only trouble is that you don’t <em>know</em> which changes you’re going to make. If you knew that some circumstance of fate would make you change the sixth, thirteenth, and fourty-fourth variables, you would set up a single button that would let you do exactly that change and nothing else.</p>
<p>So, the length of your program should reflect, I think, the number of bits of uncertainty you have about what you will want from your program in the future. It’s about minimizing the number of bits the future-you would have to transmit to the program you write. If there are four types of changes, all of which you expect to be equally likely, then you need two on-off buttons. Off-off will refer to the first change, off-on will refer to the second, on-off to the third, and on-on to the fourth.</p>
<p>The actual changes you need to make don’t matter. They’re baked in: you’re not uncertain about them and you can’t do anything about them. If in the future you need to make change X, you need to do all that X entails, no getting around it. You’re just uncertain about which change you would need to make.</p>
<h1 id="unlikely-changes">Unlikely changes</h1>
<p>Now we’ll take the case where some changes are more likely than others. Say you have just two types of changes, but you expect the first one to occur three times as often as the second one. That is, you expect the first one with 0.75 probability and the second one with 0.25 probability. The future-you knows this about you. So, how long a message does he need to send to inform the program about the change that he needs to make?</p>
<p>From information theory, we know the number of bits needed to represent an outcome of probability p is -log2(p). So, he needs -log2(0.75) = ~0.42 bits to represent the first case and -log2(0.25) = 2 bits to represent the second case.</p>
<p>(Note, there is also the case where no change is needed and we need to represent that default message too.)</p>
<p>A corollary is that if you knew exactly what you would need a program to do in the future, then you wouldn’t need any buttons for change at all. You could just hardcode the program and use it forever. Similarly, if you knew very little about what would change, you would have to have lots and lots of buttons for change. You couldn’t hardcode anything. You would have to make everything abstract, in case it changed value; like extracting variables instead of using magic numbers, extracting functions in case you need to either change the logic or re-use the same logic elsewhere, etc.</p>
<p>Why do we encapsulate change (by extracting functions and such)? To minimize the work needed to change the logic in the future. If you’ve repeated the same logic in N places, you need to change N locations or risk having a wrong program. By extracting a function with that logic, you save work on the order of N, which is usually just two or three.</p>
<h1 id="the-upshot">The Upshot</h1>
<p>What can we conclude? I think the size of a program represents how uncertain you are about its future changes. Programmers want to minimize the amount of work to make any change needed in the future, so they design their programs to make likely changes easy and unlikely changes hard. (You can’t make both types of change easy.) And since the ease of a change is generally about the number of lines of code changed, this means that you would need to modify only a few lines for an expected change, and a lot of lines for an unexpected change.</p>
<p>So, experienced programmers will probably write code that is easy to change over time, because they know exactly what changes to expect in the future.</p>
<h1 id="abstractions">Abstractions</h1>
<p>I suspect that we decouple parts of a system when we’re confident that they won’t affect each other in the future. When designing a car, you can think about the colour scheme independent of the design of the engine, because you expect that they have little or nothing to do with each other.</p>
<p>Abstraction means that we don’t care about what’s inside a box as long as it behaves a certain way on the outside. For our abstraction not to leak, the inside of the box must be independent of the other parts of the system. Otherwise, our inferences will go wrong. We can justifiably believe that pressing the brakes will make our car slow down because there’s nothing interfering in the connection between the pedal and the engine. However, if someone comes and cuts the brake wires, our above assumption will be wrong and the car won’t behave the way we want it to.</p>
<p>So, we can decide on a level of abstraction for a problem by thinking about what parts of the system don’t interact with each other. That is the first higher-level assumption we have to make in our hypothesis. Everything else follows from our choice of abstractions.</p>
<p>We get powerful abstractions when we choose as big an aspect of the system that is independent of the other aspects most of the time. Should it be completely independent? How do we decide on abstractions for a particular system?</p>
<p>In short, an abstraction says that the inside of a box is independent of the rest of the system, given that it satisfies the interface. That is, P(Inside | Any Other Part, Satisfies Interface) = P(Inside | Satisfies Interface). Knowing about any other part of the system gives you no more information about the inside of this part, once you know that it satisfies some interface. How can we discover such parts of the system?</p>
<h1 id="what-dont-you-mark-as-variables">What don’t you mark as variables?</h1>
<p>You don’t encapsulate things that you don’t expect to change at all. These are things you’re nearly certain about.</p>
<h1 id="variables-and-instruments">Variables and Instruments</h1>
<p>How does precision of the instruments we have affect the level of abstraction of variables?</p>

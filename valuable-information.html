<h1 id="information-at-what-price">Information At What Price?</h1>
<p>So, you’re in a research lab studying a system. Maybe you’re studying a new biological species, a new kind of viral disease, or a new car engine design.</p>
<p>Here’s the question: how much should you spend studying this system?</p>
<p>Should you spend just $10? Maybe $10,000? Or perhaps $10,000,000?</p>
<p>What decides that amount? And it doesn’t have to be in dollar costs. It could be in the amount of <em>time</em> you spend as researchers. Maybe it takes you 10 man-months (say, 10 researchers studying it for a month) to study it.</p>
<p>Is it worth it?</p>
<h1 id="the-decision-is-all-that-matters">The Decision Is All That Matters</h1>
<p>It all depends on the decision you want to make based on your research.</p>
<p>If all you want to know about the viral disease is whether or not you should quarantine people who have it, then you need to study just enough to find out what will happen if you quarantine and what will happen if you don’t. You don’t need to sequence the virus’ DNA before you end the study. You don’t need to run a ten-month randomized control trial on mice, monkeys, and men. Something to the effect of “it transmits itself to other people very quickly and kills them in a month” - that is all you need to know before you decide to quarantine the carriers.</p>
<p>All the other information you get is in vain. Information is useless if it cannot change your decisions.</p>
<p>This key idea impacts every single decision we make about learning and research. How much time and effort should you spend studying your gigantic economics textbook? Well, it depends on the decisions you plan to make based on it. If all you want to know is how much money your cooking-recipe startup will make (and thus, whether you should go ahead with it or not), then you just need the first two chapters on micro-economics (short answer: too much supply, too little demand). Any further time spent on the further chapters is a waste (from the viewpoint of this decision) because it doesn’t change your decision at all.</p>
<p>Should you read entire books? It takes time and effort to read books to the end. But is it worth it? Well, ask what decisions depend on this book. If you’re reading the book for some practical benefit, not for the entertainment, then the whole book doesn’t affect your decisions.</p>
<h1 id="key-areas">Key areas</h1>
<p>To what extent should you study a system, like the economy, human psychology, a programming language, or space?</p>
<p>It depends on the decisions you want to change. I’ll assume that you’re not doing these purely for fun. If you’re not going to ever interact with any matter from beyond the solar system, why study it? Sure, if things go well, we’d want the human race to colonize the solar system and beyond. But right now, that money has other interests it can serve better.</p>
<p>How many blog posts should you read? How many books? How many video lectures, scientific journals, and Facebook posts?</p>
<hr />
<p>Most of all, what this tells us is: which information source is best at this moment? Answer: The one with the most Expected Value of Information (EVI).</p>
<pre><code>EVI = Expected Value (after) - Expected Value (before)</code></pre>
<h1 id="decision-oriented-thinking">Decision-Oriented Thinking</h1>
<p>You <em>cannot</em> talk about a model without the decisions it informs. Else, you will be stuck studying a leaf because you will have no idea when to stop.</p>
<p>“How do we fix a complex-looking mess (like in war or a tough business project)?”</p>
<p>Well, what are your choices?</p>
<p>What you <em>really</em> want to know is, which choice do I make? That’s what it all boils down to.</p>
<p>So, you can never do better than improving somebody’s decision. All the information in the world is useless after you’ve made your decision. The decision is all that matters.</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>Get categories for decision-oriented thinking vs the alternatives. Get exemplars for each. Then, get a causal model for their effects.</p>
<p>Finally, show how this changes some important decisions.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-the-voi-of-academic-research">What is the VoI of academic research?</h1>
<p>I suspect it’s not very high.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-compare-mediums">How to compare mediums?</h1>
<p>How do we judge the relative quality and importance of mediums like essays, journal papers, news articles, books, speeches, classroom lectures, etc.?</p>
<p>Look at the decisions they’ve improved. For example, an essay on the scientific method could clear your understanding of a “scientific hypothesis” from a black box to a clear causal model. That’s it. Job done. You don’t need anything else.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-resolve-information-overload">How to resolve information overload?</h1>
<p>Like when you’re looking at hundreds of thousands of posts on Stack Overflow, millions of news articles online, billions of blog posts, or zillions of books.</p>
<p>Organize the information by decisions. The information you get from a particular blog posts has to improve one or more decisions. If it doesn’t, throw it away. If it does, then file it away under those decisions.</p>
<h1 id="references">References</h1>
<p>Many thanks to Douglas Hubbard for his wonderful book “How to Measure Anything”. I read it in 2013 and felt it was obviously important, but didn’t realize that it practically contained all the answers I needed. If there’s one thing you should get out of that book (apart from the fact that everything is “measurable”), it is that valuable information is all that matters.</p>

<h1 id="information-at-what-price">Information At What Price?</h1>
<p>You’re in a research lab studying a system. Maybe it’s a new biological species, a new kind of viral disease, or a new car engine design.</p>
<p>Here’s the question: how much should you spend studying this system?</p>
<p>Should you spend just $10? Maybe $10,000? Or perhaps $10,000,000?</p>
<p>What decides that amount? And it doesn’t have to be in dollar costs. It could be in the amount of <em>time</em> you spend as researchers. Maybe it takes you 10 man-months (like 10 researchers studying it for a month) to study it.</p>
<p>Is it worth it?</p>
<h1 id="the-decision-is-all-that-matters">The Decision Is All That Matters</h1>
<p>It all depends on the decision you want to make based on your research.</p>
<p>If all you want to know about the viral disease is whether or not you should quarantine people who have it, then you need to study just enough to find out what will happen if you quarantine and what will happen if you don’t. You don’t need to sequence the virus’ DNA before you end the study. You don’t need to run a ten-month randomized control trial on mice, monkeys, and men. Something to the effect of “it transmits itself to other people very quickly and kills them in a month” - that is all you need to know before you decide to quarantine the carriers.</p>
<p>All the other information you get is in vain. Information is useless if it cannot change your decisions.</p>
<p>This key idea impacts every single decision we make about learning and research. How much time and effort should you spend studying your gigantic economics textbook? Well, it depends on the decisions you plan to make based on it. If all you want to know is how much money your cooking-recipe startup will make (and thus, whether you should go ahead with it or not), then you just need the first two chapters on micro-economics (short answer: too much supply, too little demand). Any further time spent on the further chapters is a waste from the viewpoint of this decision because it doesn’t change your decision at all.</p>
<p>Should you read entire books? It takes time and effort to read books to the end. But is it worth it? Well, ask what decisions depend on this book. If you’re reading the book for some practical benefit, not for the entertainment, then the whole book doesn’t affect your decisions.</p>
<h1 id="key-areas">Key areas</h1>
<p>To what extent should you study a system, like the economy, human psychology, a programming language, or space?</p>
<p>It depends on the decisions you want to change. I’ll assume that you’re not doing these purely for fun. If you’re not going to interact with any matter from beyond the solar system in your lifetime, why study it? Sure, if things go well, we want the human race to colonize the solar system and beyond. But right now, that money has other interests it can serve better.</p>
<p>How many blog posts should you read? How many books? How many video lectures, scientific journals, and Facebook posts?</p>
<hr />
<p>You’re in the middle of a career move. You’ve got two people you could talk to about the new company you’re considering joining. Whom should you talk to first? How much time should you invest in each?</p>
<p>You have two books you’re interested in, but you only have enough money to purchase one. Which one should you purchase? Similarly, when you only have time to study one book or website, which one should you choose?</p>
<p>You’re meeting up with an expert in a field. You only have time for a few questions. Which questions should you ask him?</p>
<p>All this comes down to the question: which information source is better?</p>
<h1 id="evi">EVI</h1>
<p>Answer: The one with the most Expected Value of Information (EVI).</p>
<pre><code>EVI = Expected Value (after) - Expected Value (before)</code></pre>
<h1 id="decision-oriented-thinking">Decision-Oriented Thinking</h1>
<p>You <em>cannot</em> talk about a model without the decisions it informs. Else, you will be stuck studying a leaf because you will have no idea when to stop.</p>
<p>“How do we fix a complex-looking mess (like in war or a tough business project)?”</p>
<p>Well, what are your choices?</p>
<p>What you <em>really</em> want to know is, which choice do I make? That’s what it all boils down to.</p>
<p>So, you can never do better than improving somebody’s decision. All the information in the world is useless after you’ve made your decision. The decision is all that matters.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-the-expected-value-of-information">What is the Expected Value of Information?</h1>
<p>Take an information source like a news article. What is the expected value of that information?</p>
<p>It depends on the decisions to which that information matters. If you don’t expect it to change any decision, then that information is useless.</p>
<p>TODO: How do we figure out EVI given one decision? What if there are several decisions?</p>
<p>Take the exemplar of making the ad. Figure it out for that.</p>
<h1 id="why-think-in-terms-of-decisions">Why Think In Terms Of Decisions?</h1>
<p>What will happen if you don’t think in terms of decisions?</p>
<p>You will spend your time sub-optimally. You will waste time reading books that don’t improve anything, ignoring books that do. You will spend tons of money on experiments to get information that doesn’t matter (examples?). In short, you will make poorer decisions (examples?).</p>
<p>How much is the expected value of <em>this</em> information? What would you do before and after getting this information about decision-oriented thinking? What decisions will you now change?</p>
<p>Show me how things change for reading books, asking questions, and judging scientific reports.</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>Get categories for decision-oriented thinking vs the alternatives. Get exemplars for each. Then, get a causal model for their effects.</p>
<p>Finally, show how this changes some important decisions.</p>
<hr />
<p>Questions: When to stop studying a system? That is, when is information no longer useful?</p>
<p>Key category: What is the value of this information? How much should I pay for it (considering my opportunity costs)? Which information source has more expected value of information?</p>
<p>Basically, look at any message (book) or information source (book store) and immediately form the category: what is the (expected) value of this information?</p>
<p>Do that even for questions you ask yourself, like “how do I fix this mess?”. Recognize that you want information about “fixing this mess”. Ask yourself for the relevant decisions, your current options, the expected value of that information, and its costs.</p>
<p>You don’t want to know <em>how</em> to do X. What you really want to know is which choice you must make regarding X.</p>
<p>How is this the Epiphany Equation? How can we exploit it to get epiphanies on demand? (h/t Douglas Hubbard)</p>
<p>smoke alarm for fire - EVI</p>
<p>Consider thinking about value of information using causal models. Maybe have a causal link from the information source to your decision (as per the PGM book).</p>
<p>Also, what are some corollaries? Is it necessary that you change your decision? What if the decision table changes?</p>
<h1 id="what-is-the-voi-of-academic-research">What is the VoI of academic research?</h1>
<p>I suspect it’s not very high.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-compare-mediums">How to compare mediums?</h1>
<p>How do we judge the relative quality and importance of mediums like essays, journal papers, news articles, books, speeches, classroom lectures, etc.?</p>
<p>Look at the decisions they’ve improved. For example, an essay on the scientific method could clear your understanding of a “scientific hypothesis” from a black box to a clear causal model. That’s it. Job done. You don’t need anything else.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-resolve-information-overload">How to resolve information overload?</h1>
<p>Like when you’re looking at hundreds of thousands of posts on Stack Overflow, millions of news articles online, billions of blog posts, or zillions of books.</p>
<p>Organize the information by decisions. The information you get from a particular blog posts has to improve one or more decisions. If it doesn’t, throw it away. If it does, then file it away under those decisions.</p>
<h1 id="random-examples">Random examples</h1>
<p>How to find out if a Youtube video is worth watching? My answer: click at the middle of the time bar. And maybe some other points too. These probes will give you valuable information (I feel). Formalize this.</p>
<h1 id="references">References</h1>
<p>Many thanks to Douglas Hubbard for his wonderful book “How to Measure Anything”. I read it in 2013 and felt it was obviously important, but didn’t realize that it practically contained all the answers I needed. If there’s one thing you should get out of that book (apart from the fact that everything is “measurable”), it is that valuable information is all that matters.</p>

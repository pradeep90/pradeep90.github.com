<p>the term “economic inequality” … means the variation between different quantiles’ wealth or income.</p>
<p>If he thinks what “economic inequality” means is poverty and lack of social mobility, it’s not surprising he was upset enough to write a reply to my essay. In fact I suspect much if not most of the angry reaction to it was a result of people not understanding what the term “economic inequality” means.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Previously, PG had clarified the meaning of the term “income or wealth distribution”: statistical distribution, not pie distribution. For example, when you say height is distributed unequally, you don’t mean that there’s some central repository of heights and much of it is given to seven-foot NBA players and little to circus midgets.</p>

<p>what would an ordinary person do, if confronted with a symbol that indicated that somebody has more status than them?</p>
<p>They’ll buy into the first half-credible explanation on why that status symbol doesn’t mean anything, and then they’ll feel higher status than all the “dumb” people buying into that status symbol, because <strong>few people can tell the difference between cynicism and intelligence</strong> (disturbingly few people even realize the two concepts are distinct, actually). Think about all the people -already doing that- because some villagers apparently fish with their mosquito nets, thus disproving EA can be useful - clearly the argument is fallacious, but that doesn’t matter, because they’re rationalizing what they already want to believe, because EA is already threatening their sense of relative status.</p>
<p>Remember the HPMoR bit about Phoenixes as status symbols? Same principle.</p>

<p>We like to find some minor flaw in somebody’s idea so that we can denounce it, put them down as idiots, and remove the threat of them being higher status than us. (So it seems to me.)</p>
<p>Cynicism neutralizes status symbols. As does ridicule.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or consider another medium: movies. Have you seen the IMDB’s Top 250 movies? There are excellent movies in there. Some are profound, others moving, and not a few profoundly moving. Why are you going to watch Transformers 2 or Ice Age 3? For entertainment value? But there are movies in that list which are far more entertaining, I assure you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A flaw in this argument is that we’re behaving as though the label “excellent movie” is part of the movie itself - the <a href>mind projection fallacy</a>. There might be people who will genuinely enjoy Transformers 2 (IMDb rating 6.0) over Pulp Fiction (IMDb rating 8.9). Yes, there are strong tendencies - it’s not like there aren’t movies lots of people agree are great (The Godfather, The Dark Knight). We just have different, slightly-overlapping sets of movies that we like. We have different tastes, is what I’m trying to say.</p>
<p>So, even though <em>I</em> personally cannot hope to finish watching all the TV shows ever or read all the books ever, that doesn’t mean those other books have no value at all. I may not be able to extract value from them from myself, but others might.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So even if we got in at the beginning, we never had a chance at watching so much as a small fraction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if we <em>individually</em> got in at the beginning, we wouldn’t have a chance of <em>individually</em> watching even a small fraction. But that doesn’t mean we can’t or don’t <em>collectively</em> have a shot at doing it. (I’m not saying all books get read. Just that not getting read by me doesn’t imply not getting read by anyone.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With our too too short lives, and so much to see, one does oneself a great disservice by consuming anything but the best <strong>[for us]</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And thus, do not authors &amp; artists do us a disservice by creating mediocrity <strong>[as per <em>some</em> people’s tastes]</strong> we, being only human, will at least try? Maybe these authors &amp; artists are only creating attractive nuisances!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-core-arguments">The core arguments</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s look back on the argument:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Society ought to discourage economically inefficient activities.</li>
<li>At least, it ought not to encourage inefficiency. It may not do this perfectly, but this is still a desiderata; special pleading for some activity, saying that some other activity or market is far more economically inefficient, is not a good reason.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If some good a can be created to fill a need, and there is an existing &amp; available good b that fills that need equally well, then it is economically inefficient to use a and not b.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>We’re implicitly assuming that good a is created to fill only one need (and that too for society at large).</p>
<p>Consider when the good a affects several variables of your multi-variable utility function. Say, some novel gives you comfort when you’re sad, makes you laugh out loud when you’re in a jolly mood, and teaches you something new about the world. Now, good b might be heaps better at comforting you or cheering you up, but may not teach you nearly as much about the world. So, now should you refrain from creating good a when good b already exists?</p>
<p>That problem is not unsolvable, mind you. A utility function over those three variables would tell you how much value you can expect from good a and how much value you can expect from good b. You can thus make your decision. But, you still have to know your utility function (and your probabilities over the outcomes) very well, which I don’t think is a luxury we have.</p>
<p>Worse, people have different preferences. Even assuming the same variables, good a might cheer you up, but sadden somebody else. Justin Bieber music might excite your friend, but drive you out of your mind.</p>
<p>So, there’s no simple objective way to compare the “value” of two goods. The worth of the good isn’t part of it like some label slapped on to it (“value of this song: 5.47 utilons”). The “value” label exists in your mind.</p>
<p>TODO: Conclude your argument and compare with his conclusions.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Consumers of new art would be equally satisfied by existing art.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>What about the joy of enjoying something that a lot of others enjoy? (Yes, there’s a social proof bias - we like a painting more when others like it too. But, there is something said for collective enjoyment - that seems to be a major reason for festivals and other get-togethers. Maybe the bias is the whole explanation, but we might not want to remove it and become hermits.)</p>
<p>I guess maybe if you only had existing art, you could still enjoy stuff together, just not new stuff.</p>
<p>Also, art <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/o0/where_to_draw_the_boundary/">seems</a> to be about inspiring <em>complex</em> emotions. So, we can’t compare it on just one or two dimensions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By 2 &amp; 3: it is economically inefficient to produce new art.</p>
<p>1 &amp; 4: Society ought to discourage new art</p>
<p>In short: old stuff is as good as the new, and it’s cheaper; so making new stuff is wasteful.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Artists are competing with each other (and with past artists) for a limited amount of human attention. There are only so many people and so many hours in a life (say around half a million waking hours, <a href="http://www.gwern.net/Culture%20is%20not%20about%20Esthetics">as per</a> Gwern). Artists, marketers, fashion designers, and other meme-creators are trying to optimize for attention-share (or, to be even more precise, the profits generated), not necessarily audience enjoyment.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>I hope I’ve made my point: we live in an age of utter media abundance. Like none before us, we can partake of the greatest works in all mediums of all ages. We do not sip from a fountain laboriously supplied by hard-working artists &amp; authors, nor even guzzle from a fire-hose hooked up to a printing press; we are being shot off Niagara Falls. The impact alone will kill us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<hr />
<p>Also remember how Eliezer (and Harry Potter) said he was practically raised by his science-fiction novels. You may not get those ideals of enlightenment and positive futurism from the ancient books. There are lots of such ideals. (Check how valid this argument is.)</p>

<h1 id="the-great-horse-manure-crisis-of-1894">The Great Horse Manure Crisis of 1894</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>But this wasn’t just a British crisis: New York had a population of 100,000 horses producing around 2.5m pounds of manure a day.</p>
<p>This problem came to a head when in 1894, The Times newspaper predicted… <strong>“In 50 years, every street in London will be buried under nine feet of manure.”</strong></p>
<p>This became known as the ‘Great Horse Manure Crisis of 1894’.</p>
<p>The terrible situation was debated in 1898 at the world’s first international urban planning conference in New York, but no solution could be found. It seemed urban civilisation was doomed.</p>
<p>However, necessity is the mother of invention, and the invention in this case was that of motor transport. Henry Ford came up with a process of building motor cars at affordable prices. Electric trams and motor buses appeared on the streets, replacing the horse-drawn buses.</p>
<p>By 1912, this <strong>seemingly insurmountable problem</strong> had been resolved; in cities all around the globe, horses had been replaced and now motorised vehicles were the main source of transport and carriage.</p>
<p>Even today, in the face of a problem with no apparent solution, people often quote ‘The Great Horse Manure Crisis of 1894’, urging people not to despair, something will turn up!</p>

<p>Good to know that even such an “impossible” problem was solved. But I don’t think we can take that as evidence that all such “impossible” problems will be solved (like climate change, oil depletion, or unfriendly superintelligence).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thinking clearly is super-hard, but perhaps it is a learnable skill.</p>
<p>Rocket science is a learnable skill, but if you want to have it you should probably spend at least ten years in college, grad school, NASA internships, et cetera. You should probably read hundreds of imposing books called things like Introduction To Rocket Science. It’s not something you just pick up by coincidence while you’re doing something else.</p>
<p>If thinking clearly is a learnable skill, where are the grad schools for it? Where are the textbooks? … What all of this “only domain-specific knowledge stuff matters” effectively implies is that “thinking clearly” is so easy you can pick it up by coincidence while working on pretty much anything else - something we believe about practically no other skill. If you trusted a rocket scientist who had never read a single rocket science textbook to be any good at rocket science, you’d be insane, but we routinely trust the subjects we most need to think clearly about to people who have never read a How To Think Clearly textbook - and I can’t blame us, because such textbooks, or at least good evidence-based textbooks of the same quality as the rocket science ones, simply don’t exist.</p>

<p>Quote from Superforecasting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The humility required for good judgment is not self-doubt - the sense that you are untalented, unintelligent, or unworthy. It is intellectual humility. It is a recognition that reality is profoundly complex, that seeing things clearly is a constant struggle, when it can be done at all, and that human judgment must therefore be riddled with mistakes. This is true for fools and geniuses alike. So it’s quite possible to think highly of yourself and be intellectually humble. In fact, this combination can be wonderfully fruitful. Intellectual humility compels the careful reflection necessary for good judgment; confidence in one’s abilities inspires determined action.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>On what makes good forecasters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what are they really good at? Tetlock concludes that the number one most important factor to being a superforecaster is really understanding logic and probability.</p>
<p>Part of it is just understanding the basics. Superforecasters are less likely to think in terms of things being 100% certain, and - let’s remember just how far left the bell curve stretches - less likely to assign anything they’re not sure about a 50-50 probability. They’re less likely to believe that things happen because they’re fated to happen, or that the good guys always win, or that things that happen will necessarily teach a moral lesson. They’re more likely to admit they might be wrong and correct themselves after an error is discovered. They’re more likely to debate with themselves, try to challenge their original perception, start asking “What could be wrong about this thing I believe?” rather than “How can I prove I’m right?”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a game changer. Before September 2011, there was no way for people to freely access paywalled research en masse; researchers like Elbakyan were out in the cold. Sci-Hub is the first website to offer this service and now makes the process as simple as the click of a single button.</p>
<p>As the number of papers in the LibGen database expands, the frequency with which Sci-Hub has to dip into publishers’ repositories falls and consequently the risk of Sci-Hub triggering its alarm bells becomes ever smaller. Elbakyan explains, “We have already downloaded most paywalled articles to the library … we have almost everything!”</p>

<p>He says the number of startups has been declining. In support of this he includes a graph with a line going down.</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>the term “economic inequality” … means the variation between different quantiles’ wealth or income.</p>
<p>If he thinks what “economic inequality” means is poverty and lack of social mobility, it’s not surprising he was upset enough to write a reply to my essay. In fact I suspect much if not most of the angry reaction to it was a result of people not understanding what the term “economic inequality” means.</p>
<p>– <a href="http://paulgraham.com/okung.html">Reply to Russel Okung</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Previously, PG had clarified the meaning of the term “income or wealth distribution”: statistical distribution, not pie distribution. For example, when you say height is distributed unequally, you don’t mean that there’s some central repository of heights and much of it is given to seven-foot NBA players and little to circus midgets.</p>
<h1 id="big-ideas">Big Ideas</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Big ideas are more different from existing things than people realize when they have them.</p>
<p>– PG</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seriously, how do you know how different your idea is from “conventional wisdom”? Do you have the empirical evidence? You’re just talking to a few friends colleagues here and there.</p>
<h1 id="the-refragmentation">The Refragmentation</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Several people have told me The Refragmentation finally explained why their parents wanted them to work for a big company.</p>
<p>– PG</p>

<h1 id="status-signalling">Status-Signalling</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>what would an ordinary person do, if confronted with a symbol that indicated that somebody has more status than them?</p>
<p>They’ll buy into the first half-credible explanation on why that status symbol doesn’t mean anything, and then they’ll feel higher status than all the “dumb” people buying into that status symbol, because <strong>few people can tell the difference between cynicism and intelligence</strong> (disturbingly few people even realize the two concepts are distinct, actually). Think about all the people -already doing that- because some villagers apparently fish with their mosquito nets, thus disproving EA can be useful - clearly the argument is fallacious, but that doesn’t matter, because they’re rationalizing what they already want to believe, because EA is already threatening their sense of relative status.</p>
<p>Remember the HPMoR bit about Phoenixes as status symbols? Same principle.</p>
<p>– <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/n7b/celebrating_all_who_are_in_effective_altruism/d1x1">Comment on LessWrong</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We like to find some minor flaw in somebody’s idea so that we can denounce it, put them down as idiots, and remove the threat of them being higher status than us. (So it seems to me.)</p>
<p>Cynicism neutralizes status symbols. As does ridicule.</p>

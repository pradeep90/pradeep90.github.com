<h1 id="scientific-method">Scientific Method</h1>
<p>Resource: PG’s essay <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/word.html">A Word to the Resourceful</a></p>
<p>Aim: Identify the categories in his causal model.</p>
<h1 id="correlations">Correlations</h1>
<p>Correlation between the least successful startups (in YC) and seeming hard to talk to; felt like there was some kind of wall between us; could never quite tell if they understood PG.</p>
<p>Correlation between the most successful startups (in YC) and whether the YC partners say of them “they can take care of themselves”. Belief: given them a lead and they’ll close it. Won’t have to babysit their fundraising rounds; they will get the money.</p>
<p>Odd correlation that two different tests seemed to show the two extremes;</p>
<p>Most common extremes are inversely correlated on the same test.</p>
<p>Analogy with the adage: “a word to the wise is sufficient”. Wise people chase down all the implications of your words, without needing your detailed explanation.</p>
<p>If you give a good founders a one line intro, he’ll chase down the money.</p>
<p>Understanding all the implications of what someone tells you is a subset of resourcefulness</p>
<p>Correlation between real-world resourcefulness, conversational resourcefulness, and often doing things you don’t want to.</p>
<p>Chasing down all the implications can sometimes lead to uncomfortable conclusions.</p>
<p>Unsuccessful founders had the conservatism that comes from weakness; analogy - they traverse idea space as gingerly as a very old person traverses the real world.</p>
<p>Correlation: the unsuccessful founders weren’t stupid; just as capable as the successful founders; just weren’t eager to follow all the implications</p>
<p>being hard to talk to doesn’t kill your startups, lack of resourcefulness does.</p>
<p>Correlation: they would fail to chase down the conversational implications, funding, users, and sources of new ideas.</p>
<p>The most immediate evidence was that they were hard to talk to.</p>
<h1 id="variables">Variables</h1>
<p>rank by success in YC</p>
<p>seem hard to talk to, feel like there was some kind of wall between us, could never quite tell if they understood me</p>
<p>whether YC partners say that the startup’s founders “can take care of themselves”; give them a lead and they’ll close it; won’t have to babysit their fundraising rounds; they will get the money.</p>
<p>performances on a test for the extremes of a population</p>
<p>do you find one test that identifies the two extremes?</p>
<p>Wise people, whether they chase down all the implications (they don’t fail to chase down), whether they need detailed explanations.</p>
<p>good founder, with one line introduction will chase down the money.</p>
<p>Mechanism: a little external input leads to the desired outcome, with a lot of uncomfortable work along the way.</p>
<p>weakness, can’t take the discomfort, and so will not get to the desired outcome.</p>
<p>ability to chase down the implications, funding, users, and new ideas.</p>
<p>resourcefulness, willingness and ability to do the above</p>
<p>immediate evidence</p>
<h1 id="lessons">Lessons</h1>
<p>If you have five binary variables, they can take 32 possible states. However, if they are correlated with each other, say they all appear true or false together, then you have a combined variable with just two states. Thus, categories help you reduce the number of states. Put differently, they let you reduce the collection’s entropy. Instead of expecting 32 possible messages, all with 1/32 probability, you now expect just two messages with probability 1/2.</p>
<p>So, it’s not the number of states that you want to minimize. It’s their entropy! You could have a million states but if you expect one with near 100% probability, then the entropy is almost zero.</p>
<h1 id="further-questions">Further questions</h1>
<p>Question: How do you set the value of a variable if it’s made of several variables?</p>
<p>Question about PG’s categories: How do you know that? How do you come to the belief that these variables will be correlated? How many pieces of evidence did you have to see? What would falsify your category? In other words, how do you update your beliefs about categories?</p>
<p>What is the structure within a category?</p>
<p>What about all the other possible variables? How did you know to ignore them?</p>

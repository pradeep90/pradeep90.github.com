<h1 id="hypothesis-essays-really-scale">Hypothesis: Essays really scale</h1>
<p>You might think that with outline-hiding, outlines would really scale. But, it doesn’t seem that way. I’m routinely surprised at how little I’ve written in an Org-mode heading. That <em>never</em> happens in Markdown. Note: They’re both at the same zoom-level in my editor, so that’s not it.</p>
<p>Linear thinking scales, I think. You know that an entire paragraph (or even a section) points in the direction of one main idea.</p>
<p>Let’s test it out experimentally.</p>
<h1 id="hypotheses">Hypotheses</h1>
<ul>
<li>H1: The differing colours in each outline heading make you think you’ve written a lot</li>
<li>H2: You judge the length (and complexity) of something by the number of visual lines it takes up (and <em>not</em> the actual number of words or characters).</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="predictions-and-observations">Predictions and Observations</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>colours-joined vs colours-not-joined</p>
<ul>
<li>H1 says: No difference.</li>
<li>H2 says: colours-joined will seem longer.</li>
<li>colours-joined - seems pretty big. Like an essay.</li>
<li>colours-not-joined - seems WAY longer. Feels like there’s a LOT of content.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>colours-joined vs joined-no-colours</p>
<ul>
<li>H1 says: colours-joined will seem longer</li>
<li>H2 says: No difference</li>
<li>colours-joined - seems pretty manageable. I guess we read mainly the start and end of paragraphs and so on. Easy.</li>
<li>joined-no-colours - don’t really feel a difference in length. No colours looked cleaner - easy on the eye.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>colours-not-joined vs not-joined-no-colours</p>
<ul>
<li>H1 says: colours-not-joined will seem longer</li>
<li>H2 says: No difference</li>
<li>colours-not-joined - seems really long. Even after hiding stuff, it feels like there’s a lot in there.</li>
<li>not-joined-no-colours - equally long. Much harder to read, cos no indent.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>not-joined-no-colours vs joined-no-colours</p>
<ul>
<li>H1 says: No difference</li>
<li>H2 says: not-joined-no-colours will seem longer.</li>
<li>not-joined-no-colours - very long.</li>
<li>joined-no-colours - Didn’t feel very long at all.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Parameters</p>
<ul>
<li>Only one window</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="results">Results</h1>
<ul>
<li>H1: Experiment #3 goes directly against it. Also, #2.</li>
<li>H2: Experiments #4, #1 support it</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>H2 seems to be supported by the evidence.</p>
<h2 id="priority">Priority</h2>
<p><strong>Major Discovery</strong>: Lots of starts and ends make you feel you’ve written a lot.</p>
<p>Outline-style has lots of starts and ends. This makes you see a lot of sentences and thus you feel like there is a <em>lot</em> of content in there. So, minor and even trivial ideas can buoy you in outlines. In essays, I suspect that the individual sentences are hidden inside paragraphs. You’re forced to deal <em>only</em> with the actual major ideas (else, it would be exposed - “Why does this trivial idea have a paragraph all to itself?”)</p>
<p>In essays, you’re forced to <em>prioritize</em>. There are only so many paragraphs you have. You have to distribute them among the most important ideas. It’s hard for minor ideas to buff up the size. They are immediately exposed as irrelevant. Not so in outlines. You may think you have a lot of words (and thus a lot ideas), but you would be wrong.</p>
<p>In essays, importance is proportional to size. You don’t <em>need</em> to have “VVIP” tags in essays. The start of a paragraph itself signifies the priority and does so in a maintainable fashion - if the idea is no longer important, that paragraph will be gone.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: No need to update it manually.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: Beware of formats that have lots of starts and ends. You can fool yourself into thinking you have plenty of ideas.</p>
<p>This happens with my phone notes too, for example. Powerpoint presentations may be another case.</p>
<h2 id="linearity">Linearity</h2>
<p>Because of paragraph length constraints (&lt;= 100 words), you are forced to break your ideas into logical units (and maintain continuity).</p>
<p>Essay constraint: It all has to fit in a single linear flow from start to end. There is a tight cycle between premises and conclusions. No room for extraneous ideas. They have to leave. At each point, you will re-read the essay and eliminate what isn’t relevant. There is a strong pressure on ideas to Be Relevant or GTFO. In other words, you constantly have your eyes on the flow of ideas. Not so in outlines. Poor ideas can hide for long in the tree of ideas.</p>
<p>Hmmm… Maybe a linear flow of ideas is easier to maintain than a tree. There may be too many degrees of freedom in a tree structure. There are lots of valid states the outline can be in. So, we can excuse poor writing - it still is a tree structure. An essay, on the other hand, <em>has</em> to provide a linear sequence of ideas. Constraints foster Creativity.</p>
<p>Composition: A paragraph is nothing but the composition of a bunch of sentences so that you can treat them as one unit. Having them as separate sub-headings simply increases the complexity of the essay / outline.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-essays-scale">Conclusion: Essays scale</h2>
<p>You can keep thinking of ideas and keep correcting yourself, and it will still all fit beautifully in an essay. Books are nothing but essays taken to higher scales.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: Get rid of your Org notes.</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Another Hypothesis: Could the time spent on writing something make you feel it is more important?</p>
<p>If you speed-write a thousand words in half an hour, does it feel different from when you take an hour to compose it?</p></li>
</ul>

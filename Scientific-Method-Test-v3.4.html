<h1 id="scientific-method-v3.4">Scientific Method v3.4</h1>
<p>Here’s my v3.0 algorithm: Collect evidence, come up with small alternative models, and combine those into big models.</p>
<p>Mission: Collect 10 pieces of evidence.</p>
<p>Resource: The Will Power Instinct, by Kelly McGonigal</p>
<h1 id="chapter-four-license-to-sin">Chapter Four: License to Sin</h1>
<p>Which self is dominant in a willpower challenge depends on whether you think you’ve achieved the goals of the other self.</p>
<p>(Does this work for the bad self too? If you do a lot of bad stuff, will you flip to the good self?)</p>
<p>Key variables: goals of each self, whether the goal got satisfied, what you end up doing (do you reject your impulses or go with them?)</p>
<h1 id="evidence">Evidence</h1>
<p>Moral licensing intervention: Rejecting obviously sexist or racist statements makes you feel like you have established your moral credentials.</p>
<p>When you feel you have been good enough, you trust your impulses. So, whether or not you go with your impulses depends on how moral or virtuous you feel.</p>
<p>Charity intervention; business manager intervention.</p>
<p>Correlation: People don’t feel out of control of their choices. They don’t feel guilty. (I think the assumption is that when you normally have a willpower struggle and follow your impulses against your will, you feel out of control and guilty.)</p>
<p>Also, they feel proud of themselves for earning a reward. They think indulging themselves is the best reward for virtue.</p>
<p>Intervention: Making people just think about doing volunteer work increased their desire for splurging (on unrelated things).</p>
<p>Intervention: Thinking about what we didn’t do but could have done also makes us feel virtuous.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: How moral we feel needn’t be correlated with how moral we actually are.</p>
<p>Intervention: Asking people about dubious moral scenarios provokes instant revulsion.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: whether it feels wrong depends on whether we have a gut feeling that it is immoral.</p>
<p>Whether we have a gut feeling that something is wrong depends on how virtuous we feel.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: whether going against your best interests seems like a treat depends on how virtuous you feel.</p>
<p>Basically, if it doesn’t feel wrong, it’s not a willpower challenge at all! Everything else you did to boost your willpower has been bypassed. So, whether you have a conscious willpower challenge depends on whether it feels wrong (which, of course, depends on whether you feel virtuous.)</p>
<p>One hypothesis: If you don’t think about some willpower challenge in terms of moral judgments, then even if you feel virtuous (for whatever reason), you won’t indulge yourself in that area.</p>
<p>Alternative hypothesis: if you don’t think about some willpower challenge in terms of moral judgments, you won’t feel virtuous when you succeed at it, and thus will not indulge yourself senselessly.</p>
<p>Another one: If you think about some willpower challenge in terms of moral judgments, then when you do it well, you will feel virtuous, and when you feel virtuous (for whatever reason), you won’t feel like resisting your impulses in these moral challenges. In other words, virtue lets a challenge bypass your awareness only if you think about it in terms of moral judgments.</p>
<p>Or: maybe you will bypass a challenge if you’re feeling virtuous, period. Doesn’t matter if you think about that challenge in terms of moral judgments.</p>
<p>Intervention: Becoming aware that you’re making progress on a goal makes you engage in self-sabotaging behaviour.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: What determines whether you become aware of a willpower challenge? Whether you <em>feel</em> like you’ve done enough - whether you have been “virtuous” enough or you’ve “progressed” enough.</p>
<p>Intervention: Progress vs commitment and behaviour in the face of temptation.</p>
<p>Intervention: Remembering why you had resisted the temptation last time makes you less tempted (or is it that you’re more aware of the temptation and can apply willpower?). The difference in prediction is that if you were not aware at all in the moral licensing case, you won’t feel too guilty.</p>
<p>Correlation: People who merely intend to exercise later are likely to overeat at dinner. That is your feeling of virtuousness depends even on whether you plan to do something good in the future.</p>
<p>Restaurant intervention: Healthy options on a menu make you more likely to pick the least healthy items.</p>
<p>Intervention: Those who think they have the most self-control in the presence of no-salad vs salad option.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: Optimism about the future licenses us to indulge today.</p>
<p>Interventions: Experiments about choices now when you know that you will also have choices in the future.</p>
<p>Correlation: People’s predictions about their choices.</p>
<p>Intervention: “In an ideal world” vs not; same estimates about #times they will exercise. Also, “do not provide an idealistic prediction, but rather the most realistic prediction” -&gt; even more optimism.</p>
<p>Correlation: Actual number of times exercised was much lower.</p>
<p>Intervention: Now, how many times will you exercise in the next two weeks -&gt; even higher than initial predictions, much higher than actual outcomes</p>
<p>Intervention: Reduce variability -&gt; they gradually reduce the amount they smoke.</p>
<p>Intervention: Pair a cheeseburger with a green salad vs not -&gt; estimate fewer calories;</p>
<p>Correlation: Shoppers who buy chocolate for a charity -&gt; reward their good deed by eating more chocolate; Gift-givers may feel so generous that they decide they, too, deserve a gift.</p>
<p>Intervention: organic vs not -&gt; fewer calories</p>
<p>Correlation: More pro-environment a person was, the more they underestimated the calories</p>
<p>Correlation: people who chose to purchase an eco-friendly product -&gt; more likely to cheat on a test that paid them for correct answers</p>
<p>Intervention: Licensing effect is most likely when people pay a “penance” for bad behaviour</p>
<p>Intervention: Charging a late fine increases late pickups.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: Paying a penance erases your guilt.</p>
<p>Intervention: Replacing a harmful act with something good for the environment -&gt; no such licensing effect</p>
<p>Hypothesis: Such green acts don’t reduce guilt but increase your commitment to the environmental cause.</p>
<p>Prediction: Our commitment is increased -&gt; we will look for more ways to live our values</p>
<p>Hypothesis: believe that you’re really the bad self -&gt; reward yourself for good behaviour; punish yourself -&gt; self-control</p>

<h1 id="how-well-am-i-doing">How Well am I Doing?</h1>
<p>In my <a href="./what-creates-meaning.md">last essay</a>, we saw how the lack of constraints can make us feel that our life lacks “meaning”, how it makes us struggle to decide. Adding constraints should make our decisions clearer and make us feel our life has more “meaning”. But we don’t want to add constraints just for the sake of clearer decisions.</p>
<p>That begs the question: what are we optimizing for? How will we know we have succeeded? There is no meter for “meaning”. It would be a shame if we went ahead thinking we have nailed it and found, decades later, that we have failed.</p>
<p>Even that begs the question. What does “failed” mean? I’m vaguely assuming that <span class="math inline">\(Pradeep_{2060}\)</span>, on his deathbed, will look back, nod at a life “well-lived”, and breathe his last. But why should I slog my whole life for the sake of that one last moment? Why even care about that old man’s approval? Maybe there won’t even be a deathbed, say, if I die in a car crash. I’m <span class="math inline">\(Pradeep_{2023}\)</span> and I’m living now. What’s in it for me?</p>
<p>Naively, I like things that make me happy and I dislike things that make me unhappy. But I can’t go around playing video games all life - I need to pay my bills. So, not all joys are good and not all pains are bad. We can’t just go by the immediate consequences; we need to consider the expected distant consequences.</p>
<h1 id="align-behavior-with-long-term-consequences">Align Behavior with Long-term Consequences</h1>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: The more we bring our present behavior in line with its known long-term consequences, the more fun we will have over our lifetime.</p>
<p>If ignoring a problem will fetch negative consequences, then people who do whatever it takes to fix it will have more fun than those who don’t. For example, people who pay their bills have more fun (or suffer less pain) than those who don’t pay and get sent to jail.</p>
<p>If doing something has fetched greater positive consequences than other actions, people who do it will have more fun. For example, exercising and getting to a low body fat % has made people smile a lot (and got smiles from others); we will probably get those benefits too.</p>
<p>But if there have been no big consequences either way, then we will waste a lot of resources on it with little to show. For example, we may think that missing a promotion will hurt us a lot, but if others have found that it actually hasn’t, we would be wasting a lot of hard work that we could have used to do other fun stuff. Conversely, we may think that buying the latest iPhone will make us much happier in the future, but if others have found that it hasn’t, we would be going into debt and working hard to pay for it instead of having fun. Others may have found that binge-watching YouTube videos or TV shows wasn’t actually fun, so if we mindlessly sink hours into them, we would be having less fun than otherwise.</p>
<p>In short, we don’t want to waste our time and money on things that (we believe) won’t have worthwhile long-term consequences.</p>
<p>“Long-term” doesn’t mean that the consequence has to be in the distant future; we just calculate the net effect of the action over the long term. If you eat a scrumptious meal and run extra long to burn it off, then you will have enjoyed in the near term and will not suffer in the long term, making it a net positive.</p>
<p>Note that this is not a circular or unfalsifiable hypothesis. Past experience may not extrapolate to the future. Who knows, maybe future smartphones will have drugs in them that get you high without hangovers; so, if you abjured luxury goods en masse, you would have missed out on a ton of fun. Maybe you are one of the people who would have been happier with the promotion - you don’t know. But we can only make decisions with information from the past, not from the future, so we just have to bear it (and remain open to changes when we get to the future).</p>
<h1 id="how-well-am-i-doing-revisited">How Well am I Doing? (revisited)</h1>
<p>Does the above hypothesis tell us how much “meaning” we have? Well, does it help us make clear decisions? Yes. We can develop constraints based on known long-term consequences - exercise has made people healthier and happier over a lifetime, so do it regularly; paying bills has been good for people over a lifetime, so grit yourself and do it; buying luxury goods has usually not been worth it, so avoid it; burning yourself out for a promotion has usually not paid off (or has, depending on whose experiences you look at), so either do it or don’t. So, thinking in terms of net consequences over a lifetime tells us how to add constraints.</p>
<p>Let’s answer the questions I had at the beginning. What is a “failed” life? Rather, what would be more or less of a “failure”? The more we waste our resources, the less fun we have, and thus the more of a “failure” it is.</p>
<p>Am I just working for the sake of a nice imaginary obituary when I’m on my deathbed? Nope, at each point of my life, I’ll be having fun. It’s just that I’ll be more responsible and think about future Pradeeps as well. Yes, we could get fancy here, and figure out how much I should weigh present fun against future fun, and, in fact, how much of a future I can expect to have. But, for now, let’s keep things simple and just avoid known, terrible wastes of time.</p>
<p>How can I tell how well I’m doing at each point? I can check how many constraints I’m violating at any point. For example, if I spend a thousand dollars on a brand-new smartphone, and I have seen evidence that costlier smartphones don’t make you much happier, then I’m violating that constraint. The more constraints I satisfy, the more fun I can hope to have.</p>
<h1 id="biggest-mismatches">Biggest Mismatches</h1>
<p>Where can we change our lives for the most impact?</p>
<p>If we’re already exercising regularly or paying our bills, there’s not much to change there. But if we have been burning ourselves out for promotions just to avoid disappointing our parents, or going deep into debt to afford fancy cars and phones in the hopes that their pleasures will be proportionate to their price tags, then we could saves ourselves a lot of pain and futile effort.</p>
<p>In the coming essays, I’ll talk about where we waste the most resources, why we persist in these actions despite their futility, and what we can do to get rid of them.</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>I was inspired by the following book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A] culture brings the individual under the control of remote consequences</p>
<p>– B F Skinner, Beyond Freedom and Dignity (2011)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was also inspired by the textbook, Behaviour Modification, by Raymond G. Miltenberger, which calls the problem of mismatched behavior as a problem of “self-management”, where there is a “conflict between short-term contingencies and long-term outcomes”.</p>

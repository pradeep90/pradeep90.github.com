<h1 id="questions">Questions</h1>
<p>How to quantify my uncertainty about the stuff taught in a course so far? Basically, how do I distinguish between “don’t understand some of the concepts yet” and “don’t understand anything at all”? Is it just the number of questions I can’t answer? Something like the number of branches not yet implemented for a function?</p>
<p>How much work will it take me to get up to scratch?</p>
<p>How many categories and property associations do I make from the chapters and lectures so far? What is the category feedback? How many different forms of category feedback do I need to consider? What are tentative lower and upper bounds on the number of associations needed to answer questions on the exam? What if you created an index for PL, including points you haven’t studied? Would that help? What’s your output category feedback? How many associations per class and thus how many in total? What do nested or deeper categories look like? How many categories tested in the homework?</p>
<p>How far are my essays from being “clean”? Is it simply the lack of tests? Or will an index do the trick? What’s the difference between “clean” material like books or published articles and my own essay drafts? What’s the output variable here? What would be the differences among an essay with an index, an essay with “tests” (whatever that means), an essay with both, and an essay that I consider “clean”?</p>
<p>Finally, how much of my daily work is induction and category recognition and how much is executing a sequence of actions? How much is searching for an instance?</p>
<p>Is it that you need a sequence only when you don’t have a button that regenerates a stored instance? What about procedures like adding two numbers? Basically, you have to execute the function definition by hand. Think about it: if it’s a skill, that means you’ve done it or something similar before. So you’re literally repeating your actions.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: If it’s a field without much automation, you’ll have to learn sequences of actions a lot.</p>
<p>If it’s a field with a lot of automation, you won’t have to learn sequences because you can save them and refer to them by labels. So you’ll spend most of your time Inducing and recognising categories and saving new definitions.</p>
<p>Also, what exactly is “deliberate practice”? What exactly happens? Why do I notice relevant factors more after half an hour of practice? Attention because of cue followed by reinforcement? Ask a pointed question.</p>

          <h1 id="post-title">Vulnerability</h1>

<h1 id="trivial-problems">Trivial problems</h1>
<p>How do I waste my time? I get worked up over trivial things. First-world problems. I become incapable of doing any work and just do stuff to numb myself (eat tasty food, watch videos on Youtube).</p>
<p>Act in spite of the pain. Ignore what seems important right now. See through to what really matters. Win.</p>
<h1 id="getting-offended">Getting offended</h1>
<p>As long as you have this habit of getting offended by other people’s behaviour, it will remain your biggest weakness. It will be the greatest source of unhappiness in your life. You get offended in hopes of fixing the situation, but getting offended is the situation. You will be much happier without it and might actually even get what you want.</p>
<h1 id="prerequisites-for-worthiness">Prerequisites for Worthiness</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“My life will begin after I get X, Y, and Z done.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two words: frequent releases. You have to start releasing the product (here, your worthiness or happiness) immediately so that you can iterate on it. Otherwise, you may never get started on it.</p>
<p>Worthiness comes now. Happiness comes now. Life is now.</p>
<h1 id="freedom">Freedom!</h1>
<p>I’m free now of one more thing that I was using as a prerequisite for worthiness. Yes, it was a silly thing. Pretty much all our prerequisites for worthiness are silly. We’re humans, the silliest species on the planet. All I had to do was feel the vulnerability and realize that it didn’t have to make we unworthy of love and belonging.</p>
<h1 id="poker-chips-take-risks-with-confidence">Poker chips: Take risks with confidence</h1>
<p>We need to have a measurement for worthiness. Otherwise, we will find it hard to make tradeoffs.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m thinking in black and white when it comes to worthiness. If someone makes fun of my appearance, it’s the end of the world. I’m completely unworthy of love and belonging. Instead, even if I do feel unworthy because of my appearance, it should only decrease my overall worthiness by a small amount.</p>
<p>In fact, if your worthiness is decided by the number of places where you refuse to bear vulnerability, then you should measure only that. Say I can’t bear looking bad or having an untidy room or whatever. Then, if I look bad, my worthiness should go down a bit. Inversely, if I grin and bear it, then my worthiness should go up.</p>
<p>Mainly, if we can think of a certain number of worthiness units in our hands, like chips in a poker game, we can decide where to risk them in a bet or where not to. For example, if I know that I have, say, 20 chips of worthiness in my hand, then I can take a risk - be vulnerable - worth around 3 chips in some area like writing an imperfect email or something. If that fails and I don’t accept the emotional pain and instead try to avoid it (which can happen if I feel too much pressure - like when others insult me), I will lose those 3 chips. If I succeed, then I would retain those 3 chips and get some more, because I overcame a prerequisite for worthiness.</p>
<p>In other words, having a good measure for worthiness will let me start embracing vulnerability with confidence. I will not fear losing my entire stock of worthiness because I know I have the remaining chips in my hand. Right now, I behave as though having one bad experience will be absolutely unbearable. Having chips in my hand will remind that this isn’t such a big deal; this too shall pass.</p>

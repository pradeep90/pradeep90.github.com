<p><strong>Entry question</strong>: What was really causing my RSI?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="oct-25">Oct 25</h1>
<p>I find a link called “How I cured my RSI” by some guy. I expect it to be some crackpot stuff. Or maybe a satire or something. Nah. It was serious. Wait, is this guy legit?</p>
<p>I looked him up. Guy’s been to YCombinator and had his startup bought by Google. Whoa. Almost surely NOT a crackpot who believes in woo-woo stuff.</p>
<p>I follow another link and go to a similar post on another blog.</p>
<p>They claim that their RSI was cured with a day or two of reading the Mind-Body Approach book. What. The. F*ck.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, I search for RSI and Mind-Body Approach and get similar posts at exactly the same level of Rave. I’ve never seen people claim such terrific results with a straight face. I’m still suspicious.</p>
<p>But… goddammit… my pain is already gone. I f*ck you not. This is gonna be hard to believe. I’m a goddamn Aspiring Rationalist myself. I am highly skeptical of miracle cures.</p>
<p>It’s like a switch has flipped in my mind. The pain has just instantly gone off. No slow retreat. No dragged out process. Just gone… like that. Finished.</p>
<p>Holy Crap! Could it be true? Was the whole chronic pain thing just in my own head?</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>All</em> pain is in your head. But usually it correlates with some damage to your body. This pain was not correlating. It was out of sync.</p>
<p>It wasn’t like I bought the whole story and <em>then</em> the pain went away. Even as I was reading the posts, the pain was on its way out. It was like the <em>mere thought</em> of this pain just being a mental creation drove it away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Dumbledore’s been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!”</p>
<p>– Tom Riddle, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just <em>questioning</em> its validity seemed to make the pain go away. What is going on here?</p>
<h1 id="later-that-day">Later that day</h1>
<p>For the first time in years, I did not approach my keyboard with fear. I had the feeling that it would not be hurtful, and it wasn’t. F*ck.</p>
<p>It didn’t hurt.</p>
<h1 id="how-did-this-happen">How did this happen?</h1>
<p>They say that the mere act of approaching something with fear and stress makes you start having pain in that area.</p>
<p>Stress and other factors. Major.</p>
<h1 id="oct-26">Oct 26</h1>
<p>I typed out about a thousand words on my keyboard. There were times when it seemed like the pain would be back or something… but nah! I typed for 3 f*cking hours and nothing bad happened. Holy crap. At each point, I was half-expecting a bomb to drop and explode my hands away. Nope. It was fine. Mild sensation. But no pain. It was nothing like the last one year. I had never typed pain-free anytime in that whole period.</p>
<h1 id="oct-27">Oct 27</h1>
<p>Have been writing and typing almost non-stop since 10am. Nothing bad has happened. Yo!</p>
<p>I plan to fork out some money to buy the Mind-Body Approach book. It deserves the Rs 587 just for the past couple of days.</p>
<h1 id="oct-29">Oct 29</h1>
<p>Pretty much no pain at all while typing. I have this weird foreboding that I’m gonna feel pain, I’m gonna feel pain… but nothing happens.</p>
<p>I’ve been typing away merrily the whole day. Nothing bad has happened. Yay!</p>
<h1 id="nov-13">Nov 13</h1>
<p>Absolutely no pain at all! Holy motherf*cking crap!</p>
<p>It’s like my hands are soft petals. There’s just no pain at all. Life is awesome!!!</p>
<p>Thank you, Dr. John E. Sarno.</p>

<p>Some odd kind of pain-like thing in my fingers over the last two days. I think I’ve been stressing myself out by sitting at the computer all day long.</p>
<p>I think I’m beginning to fear the keyboard again. Not cool.</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s see how this goes.</p>
<p>Haven’t been taking ANY micro or rest breaks over the last few days and have been doing intense coding. Plus, putting a lot of weight on my hands cos of poor eyesight (with plus glasses) and because I’m reading and working out a lot of math on the computer.</p>
<p><strong>Crazy Hypothesis</strong>: Maybe my mind is doing this to get out of doing all this HARD grinding work on deeply confusing (whoa! My internal alarms just went off!!! Essay-writing, you rock!) hardcore, punishingly complex and strict math and programming.</p>
<p>I mean, there’s so much hard work ahead of me, and I have no clue how useful it will be or how successful I will be at it… and I think my mind is jumping at the chance to get away from all this. Just be a normal guy. Not a superhero. Just a friendly, neighbourhood non-superhero. Do ordinary shit. Work ordinary hours. Live an ordinary life. Get ordinary results. Safe and sound. 7 billion people are doing it, why can’t you?</p>
<h1 id="jan-12">Jan 12</h1>
<p>Yup. My hypothesis was right, I think.</p>
<p>That happened again. I was gearing up to do some hardcore work in Haskell and all of a sudden, I started getting alarm bells.</p>
<p>“Oh, my hand is hurting again. What am I gonna do? I can’t <em>possibly</em> do all that work now. I guess I will never be able to do that sort of thing… wait a minute!”</p>
<p>I had to make an effort to tell my mind: Yo, I don’t care what you think, I’m going ahead with this. This needs to be done. I’m not going to accept any excuses. I’m not falling for your tricks again. I know that you/I are trying to get out of doing all this work by creating some pain. Not cool.</p>
<p>And that was the end of that.</p>
<p>I think that my crazy hypothesis holds. My mind really is trying to get out of doing some hardcore work in some undefined direction. And it does so by clutching at any and all means to stop me - including creating pain signals in my hand.</p>
<p>No more pain after that incident. Life is awesome!</p>

<h1 id="some-tentative-hypothesis-tests">Some tentative hypothesis tests</h1>
<h2 id="do-things-that-hurt-earlier-apparently-cos-of-my-rsi">Do things that hurt earlier (apparently cos of my RSI)</h2>
<p>What activities was I avoiding due to RSI? If they don’t hurt now, it means that my “RSI” really has been cured.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Like bending my hand at the wrist - I got tingling earlier</p></li>
<li><p>Doing that weird anti-RSI shoulder stretch at the doorway</p></li>
<li><p>Typing on the smartphone or tablet screen</p></li>
<li><p>Using the mouse or mousepad</p></li>
<li><p>Holding a book by its edge with my fingers - I used to feel pain after a short while</p>
<p>In fact, holding anything with just my fingers hurt.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I was afraid of doing these things. I was stressed about them and according to this new hypothesis, that is why I was feeling pain. Now I shouldn’t feel pain.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="further-topics">Further Topics</h1>
<p>What is the exact hypothesis?</p>
<p>What is the alternate hypothesis? (The structural hypothesis)</p>
<p>What are the differing predictions?</p>
<p>Can it explain all the stuff I’ve been through? Examples?</p>

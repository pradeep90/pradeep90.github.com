<h1 id="scientific-method-v3.0">Scientific Method v3.0</h1>
<p>Resource: The Will Power Instinct, by Kelly McGonigal</p>
<p>Mission: Summarize the Introduction chapter of the book.</p>
<p>Here’s my v3.0 algorithm: Collect evidence, come up with small alternative models, and combine those into big models.</p>
<h1 id="iterate">Iterate</h1>
<p>What is it that I need to produce? I must obtain the correct hypothesis, given all the evidence.</p>
<p>What is the test for my final product? Well, none of the evidence given should contradict my solution hypotheses. So, I need to present all the evidence and the models that are consistent with it.</p>
<p>So, first, list the variables you care about. Then, list the evidence that deals with them. Use the evidence to eliminate small causal models. Combine the remaining small models and show where they differ.</p>
<p>How can I do this iteratively? Look at the main hypothesis they’re presenting to identify the key variables. Then, first present a few pieces of evidence and generate models consistent with them (maybe by guessing wildly). Next, I can take more evidence from the chapter and refine my models. This way, at each point, I will have a set of evidence and models that are at least partly accurate.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="first-part">First part</h2>
<p>Correlation: Most people say that they want more willpower - to be in control of every aspect of their lives; but most people feel like willpower failures. So, we have a correlation between wanting willpower and not having willpower. Maybe wanting willpower causes you to not have willpower (and not wanting it causes you to have it), not having willpower causes you to want it, or something else causes both.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the variable “wanting more willpower”. What could cause it? Of course, if you had complete self-control, you wouldn’t want more willpower. So, how much willpower you have is a factor. Your goals matter too - if all you had to do was keep eating some kind of healthy, tasty chocolate as many times as you wanted, you wouldn’t need too much willpower. Basically, are your goals against your impulses? So, whether you want more willpower depends on how much willpower you have and what your goals are.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at the variable “feeling like a willpower failure”. What could cause this? Again, I think this is determined by your goals and how much willpower you were able to exert. Maybe this happens when you fail miserably - when you fall badly for temptations. That is, % of times you’ve fallen for temptations.</p>
<p>Correlation: Most people say that lack of willpower is the main reason they struggle with goals. That is, most people say that lack of self-control causes low % success in their goals. One implication is that if you increase self-control somehow, you would achieve more success. Also, if you decreased it somehow, you would achieve less success. But how exactly does self-control cause success in their goals? What can self-control do? It can help you overcome impulses and keep out distractions. What causes success, in general? Doing what is needed and not doing what is harmful. Well, self-control will be crucial here only if you can’t succeed without controlling your impulses. So, maybe we only call those things as goals that we can’t accomplish by default, things that go against our instincts. Therefore, success in goals depends on controlling our impulses, which needs willpower.</p>
<p>Correlation: People continue to rely on wrongheaded strategies for self-control, despite scientific research that might help them. % of people using strategy regularly, effectiveness of the strategy, effectiveness of scientifically-studied strategies. Maybe a strategy not being effective makes people use it (nope), people using some strategy makes it ineffective (no, the strategy was ineffective from before), or something causes both. However, not all wrongheaded strategies continue being used. So, maybe some fraction of poor strategies have some property that makes people continue relying on them. Maybe they seem to us like they should work, and so we keep using them.</p>
<p>The question is, what decides the strategies people will use? I think it is a matter of motivation - it shouldn’t be too difficult to use, it should give results quickly, it should feel like it works, etc.</p>
<p>Survey results after four weeks: 97% felt they better understood their own behaviour; 84% felt they had got more willpower due to the class. Time elapsed in the course, % who feel they’ve better understood their own behaviour, % that feel they’ve got more willpower. Either the course is causing people to say those positive things, or something else caused people to participate in the course and feel positively about it.</p>
<p>What could cause you to participate in a course? Maybe you feel it might help you, or someone is forcing you to take a certain number of courses from some department, or whatever. Now, assuming that most of the students were from the common public and not motivated by usual student concerns, we can say that they joined the course because they felt it would help them. People who felt it wouldn’t help them didn’t join the course.</p>
<p>What factors could possibly affect your course rating? Well, first, barring any foul play, the course rating will depend on how much you feel the course has helped you. That, in turn, could depend on how much the course has actually helped you, how you felt about the subject at the outset, how much low-hanging fruit you have in this area, how important this is to you, how much effort you’ve put into the course, etc.</p>
<p>Given that you had joined the course (and had thus felt that it would help you) and sat through four weeks of it, we can say you would feel that the subject will be useful to you. Also, from what I know of the theory of commitment and consistency, the more effort you put into the course, the more you will feel like you’re benefiting from it. Also, if the course really does turn your life around, you will probably feel you’ve benefited from it.</p>
<p>What are some other hypotheses? Maybe how much you feel the course has helped you depends only on how much it has actually helped you, nothing else (call this H2). Another hypothesis is that effort doesn’t matter but your feelings and actual benefit do (H3). Also, it could be that effort and actual benefit matter but your feelings don’t (H4).</p>
<p>How can we distinguish between these hypotheses? To separate H1 and H2, fix the actual benefit and vary effort or feelings. Say you have a great course, but some students don’t put in much effort - they just casually attend classes and aren’t required to do any homework or anything. Maybe they’re just “auditing” the course. H1 says you should get a difference in course ratings between these and the other students. Or, just take students who aren’t interested in the course but make them take it anyway. Their ratings should again be different.</p>
<p>To separate H1 and H3, keep feelings and actual benefit constant, and vary the effort. Take a really bad course and make some students put in a lot of effort (maybe by requiring them to take class notes). H1 predicts that their ratings will be different from the others’.</p>
<p>To separate H1 and H4, keep effort and actual benefit constant, and vary the feelings of the students. One way could be to keep effort low for everyone by offering the course during a tight semester or by not allowing anyone to take notes, perhaps. I’m finding this hard because if you feel good about the course, you will put in more effort. Maybe manipulate the effort variable directly by making some students do busywork so that they won’t have much time to work on the coursework itself.</p>
<p>The reason I’m having a problem isolating effort from feelings about the course is because I’m not being precise about how they shape your perceived benefit from the course. The “feelings” here are actually feelings from before the course about how much it will help you. And since they happened a long time ago, they can only affect your feeling about how much the course has helped you through the actions they make you take.</p>
<p>So, we need to consider the actions you take and how much “benefit” they really have. It’s not just a matter of time spent. If you have a lot of low-hanging fruit, you could put in a bit of effort and get “lots of benefits”, and if you’re already far ahead, you could put in a lot of effort and get nothing in return. Also, it’s not even about the results, it’s about the value of the results. Making a lot of progress in some low-value area might not be worth it.</p>
<h2 id="second-part">Second part</h2>
<p>Correlation: People felt the insights were useful for varied challenges. Type of challenge, were the insights useful? This is actually a bunch of correlations - the insights were useful for challenge type 1, challenge type 2, etc. Basically, they had a challenge of some type, and then they used the insights, and they performed better. Using the insights was correlated with getting better performance. The better performance could have caused them to use the insights (nonsense), or using the insights could have caused the better performance, or something could have caused them to use the insights and have better performance.</p>
<p>What could have caused better performance? These were willpower challenges, so only having more willpower for those activities could have helped. Those insights were experimentally tested ideas that produce more willpower. So, applying them could have helped. What else could it have been? How else could you have suddenly got more willpower (or motivation)? Well, working with others who were struggling like you could have motivated you to take more action. Or, just the fact that you were going to be accountable to others about your progress could have spurred you on.</p>
<p>Also, using these insights was correlated with better performance, no matter what the type of challenge. So, if the insights caused the improvement, it must have been by affecting something that is capable of helping performance in any willpower challenge. It can’t have been something specific only to a few willpower challenges.</p>
<p>Correlation: Most books on behaviour-change help you set goals and guide you in reaching them. But, most New Year’s resolutions aren’t successful. Few books address why you aren’t already doing the things you know you should. % of books, whether they help you set goals and reach them, % goals that are successful, whether they talk about why you aren’t doing what you know you should. She says there’s a correlation between books that help you set goals and your low success rate. Well, no, apparently it’s just evidence that the hypothesis “current books help you achieve goals” is wrong, because if they did, more people would succeed. Wait. Express that “hypothesis” as a causal model.</p>
<p>Correlation: People who think they have the most willpower are actually most likely to lose control when tempted. How much willpower you think you have, % of willpower failures.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: The most optimistic challengers fail to predict when, where, and why they will give in. And they expose themselves to more temptations. They’re also more likely to be surprised by setbacks and give up on their goals when they run into difficulty. optimism about your self-control, % of goals for which you predict your failure modes, #temptations you expose yourself to, how surprised you are by setbacks, % giving up when you fail.</p>
<p>Correlation: Everyone struggles in some way with willpower challenges. % of people, struggle with willpower challenge.</p>
<p>Correlation: Whatever the type of willpower challenge, we respond in pretty much the same way. Type of willpower challenge, type of response.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>There was an old story passed down among scientists, a cautionary tale, the story of Blondlot and the N-Rays.</p>
<p>Shortly after the discovery of X-Rays, an eminent French physicist named Prosper-Rene Blondlot - who had been first to measure the speed of radio waves and show that they propagated at the speed of light - had announced the discovery of an amazing new phenomenon, N-Rays, which would induce a faint brightening of a screen. You had to look hard to see it, but it was there. N-Rays had all sorts of interesting properties. They were bent by aluminium and could be focused by an aluminium prism into striking a treated thread of cadmium sulfide, which would then glow faintly in the dark…</p>
<p>Soon dozens of other scientists had confirmed Blondlot’s results, especially in France.</p>
<p>But there were still other scientists, in England and Germany, who said they weren’t quite sure they could see that faint glow.</p>
<p>Blondlot had said they were probably setting up the machinery wrong.</p>
<p>– <a href="http://hpmor.com/chapter/22">Chapter 22: The Scientific Method, HPMOR</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How would you test Blondlot’s theory about N-rays?</p>
<p>He’s claiming that if you have an aluminium prism and a treated thread of cadmium sulfide, you will get a faint glowing in the dark. In other words, he’s saying that aluminium prism and cadmium sulfide are relevant factors for the output variable of a faint glowing.</p>
<p>If the aluminium prism is truly a relevant factor, then changing it should result in some change in the output variable (for at least some baselines). So, as an initial test, remove it and see what happens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One day Blondlot had given a demonstration of N-Rays. The lights had turned out, and his assistant had called off the brightening and darkening as Blondlot performed his manipulations.</p>
<p>It had been a normal demonstration, all the results going as expected.</p>
<p>Even though an American scientist named Robert Wood had quietly stolen the aluminium prism from the center of Blondlot’s mechanism.</p>
<p>And that had been the end of N-Rays.</p>
<p>– <a href="http://hpmor.com/chapter/22">Chapter 22: The Scientific Method, HPMOR</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Robert Wood removed the aluminium prism and Blondlot still got the same result. So, the aluminium prism wasn’t really a relevant factor for a change between a faint glowing and no faint glowing! That was a pretty big blow to the N-rays theory. It meant that it wasn’t really explaining a change.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: To know the impact of a factor you’re curious about, toggle it.</p>
<p>Toggling doesn’t have to be as extreme as removing the factor entirely. You can change its value in degrees. For example, if the aluminium prism is one foot away from the cadmium sulfide, move it two feet away. If you still get the exact same result, you should be suspicious. But you can still try moving it ten feet away. If you get the same result again, you should be even more suspicious. Move it out of the room entirely and dismiss the theory if you get the same result.</p>

<p>When don’t we toggle factors? Well, you always don’t toggle factors. The change you need to explain is when you do toggle a factor.</p>

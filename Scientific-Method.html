<p><strong>Questions</strong>: How can we think scientifically?</p>
<p>Instead of trying to find the perfect description of the scientific method, let’s start with a simple, inefficient process and improve it based on feedback. Judge each version only using empirical evidence; don’t theorize idly.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="aim-obtain-a-good-model">Aim: Obtain a good model</h1>
<p>We are uncertain about the outcomes of various scenarios. We need to predict what will happen, so that we can make good decisions. We have questions we want to answer, problems we want to solve. So, we use a model of the domain to help us answer those questions.</p>
<p>The better our model, the better our predictions will be. Wait. In what sense will our predictions be better? Well, it is a matter of induction. We humans believe that if we process the evidence we have by using Bayes Theorem, we will get the most accurate predictions overall. Yes, a mythical hypothesis that made exactly the right predictions for everything you see would be great to have, but you don’t know what it is in advance. So, it doesn’t help you make future predictions. The best you can do is use Bayes Theorem constantly.</p>
<p>So, our one and only aim is to use Bayes Theorem to get a model with high posterior probability.</p>
<h1 id="goal-of-this-essay">Goal of this essay</h1>
<p>Right now, the term “causal model” is a black box to me. I don’t understand exactly how it works inside. But I need to. I want to get a complete understanding of how causal models work.</p>
<p>First, I want to know about causal models (aka hypotheses) and predictions. What does a causal model look like (and what does it not look like)? What do predictions look like (ditto)? How does a model help you make predictions? How can you find out which experiments it talks about? For how many experiments does it make predictions?</p>
<p>Next, I want to know about alternative hypotheses. How do models differ from one another? How would a model differ from an improved version of it? How do independent and dependent variables enter the picture? What do scientific experiments look like?</p>
<p>Most importantly, I want to figure out a process by which to get better hypotheses - the scientific method, in other words. Instead of trying to get it right on the first try, I want to refine the process over time using empirical evidence.</p>
<p>Remember, my aim is not to prove to others that the scientific method can be very useful. It is to test for <em>myself</em> whether the scientific method is as powerful as I think it is. I really don’t know. I get the feeling that it can be very useful as a problem-solving tool, but in the end that’s just a hunch. I need to find out for sure.</p>
<p>For that, I must learn how to formulate causal models, as taught in the domain of causality, and test my understanding on real-world problems. Only when I can solve real problems as well or better than current standards can I say that the scientific method, as I have understood it, is powerful.</p>
<h1 id="asking-how-and-why">Asking “how” and “why”</h1>
<p>When we ask “why” a model makes a certain prediction, we really want to know the values of dependent variables that come between the independent variable and the dependent variable. We want to know how it happens. We want to make the chain of reasoning more detailed.</p>
<p>To be precise, when we ask why X causes Y, we want to get a detailed chain of reasoning between X and Y. When we ask why X came about, we want to know what caused X in the first place. So, the first question is really “how” and the second one is “why”.</p>
<p>Make sure it handles changed conditions. If you say variable A causes variable B, ensure that for every value of A, you can determine the value of B. This is one of the main advantages of a cause - once you know the value of the independent variable, you don’t care about any of its ancestors or other variables.</p>
<p>Importantly, vary the other independent variables too. Example: food makes snails move faster. What if we have the smell of food, but not the food itself?</p>
<p>Also, try different ways of manipulating the independent variable. For example, to get aspirin to the brain (or whatever), directly take aspirin pills, or dissolve it in water and drink it, or inject it, or something.</p>
<p>Remember that time is a key independent variable.</p>
<p>Test the causal link in other scenarios. For example, if you say natural selection has made some gene more prevalent in some populations, check whether it increases the inclusive genetic fitness of those humans; otherwise natural selection won’t increase its relative frequency in the next generation.</p>
<p>Why do you predict this particular outcome? How come X leads to Y, and not Z? Why would an electrical field change the foraging behaviour of an insect?</p>
<h1 id="sine-qua-non">Sine qua non</h1>
<p>What is the smallest thing that can still be called a causal model? Well, that would be a single causal link.</p>
<h1 id="further-notes">Further notes</h1>
<p>Note: I need to handle feedback loops sometime. For now, we’ll just go with the hierarchy of variables.</p>
<p>I was stymied by the apparent impenetrability of the “models” I saw all around because they used symbols to represent previously-specified sub-models. That’s why it felt like they didn’t follow the model above.</p>
<h1 id="summarizing">Summarizing</h1>
<p>What about summarizing? Actually, what is summarizing? If you need each causal link in the tree, how can you compress it even further? I need to look at concrete examples of uncompressed and compressed causal models. How do they differ? Is it to do with a layer of abstraction? Are you perhaps encapsulating some parts of the model? I mean, it can’t literally be about having fewer causal links, can it? Because we’re assuming that each causal link is from an independent variable to an dependent variable. So, you have to account for the value of every variable. How can you do that with fewer causal links?</p>
<p>Maybe you summarize by abstracting common links. That is probably the same as using higher-level variables. You start to see the patterns. However, be careful to specify all the possible values of the abstract variables. Be precise.</p>
<p>I suspect that each piece of advice you get from a book is just an abstract causal link, hopefully backed by controlled experiments. However, you usually don’t know exactly how the different pieces of advice will combine. That’s why you need domain expertise to figure out how complex scenarios play out. This holds for every piece of advice ever - just having evidence from controlled experiments is not enough. You need to know how they combine.</p>
<p>What does a controlled experiment really tell you? I think it just hints at the causal structure, plus a bit about the strength of the causal link.</p>
<p>Your diary summaries are examples of succinct but predictive models. Study them. They probably will have very few, abstract causal links. To test this, look at them and see if they form abstract causal links.</p>
<h1 id="causal-diagram-vs-process-description">Causal Diagram vs Process Description</h1>
<p>I somehow feel uncomfortable with this idea of causal links between variables. It seems unsatisfactory to me.</p>
<p>What I really want is a description of the underlying process that reality is using to generate what we see. I want to know the program that reality is running. That is what programs are - descriptions of processes. And, I think, that is what hypotheses are too.</p>
<p>The idea of isolating all the variables (independent or dependent) and looking at their relationships seems too low-level to me, like I’m missing the forest for the trees. I want to know the deep process that generates those surface phenomena. Plus, the variables seem quite fragile; they seem to be based on your current tools for observation or manipulation. I want to go beyond current tools. I want to know “how the universe works on such a deep level that you know exactly what to do to make the universe do what you want”. I want an in-depth understanding of the domain, dammit.</p>
<p>I believe that is what I did instinctively when I summarized book chapters or PG essays - I came up with some simple, sweeping model that could explain all of the observations and more.</p>
<p>You need to use your model of the process to say how the system will proceed given the initial state. That is all. Wait. Also, you need to infer what happened earlier using the evidence.</p>
<p>The domain of programming really helps cement this intuition, because you can’t get away with simplistic relationships between variables. You absolutely <em>have</em> to talk about the program in its vast complexity (?). It defies easy summarization. You can see the difference in predictive power between a person who knows the program inside-out and somebody who is just making a few surface relationships. This is the power of reductionism! Once you know the actual program being executed, you can see everything! There is no question of probabilities or anything. You know damn well exactly what is going to happen at each point.</p>
<p>This is why I feel queasy about using probabilities within a hypothesis. That’s the ultimate sign that you don’t understand the domain too well - you’re basically guessing at what will happen (and will thus get a lower posterior probability than someone who makes sure predictions). If you know the exact model that underpins a domain, you will be able to predict exactly what will happen, no two ways about it.</p>
<p>Maybe we can have probabilities to represent our confidence in different hypotheses (their prior probabilities), because we don’t know which hypothesis reality is using, but within the hypothesis, we should be sure of what we expect.</p>
<p>In short, a tree belief network is just not expressive enough, I think. You need a better language with which to describe processes.</p>
<h1 id="do-some-scholarship-dude">Do some Scholarship, dude</h1>
<p>Eliezer already covered all this in his Epistemology sequence. There’s a well-understood field that studies the area of causal models - in a very rigorous, mathematical way.</p>
<h1 id="scientific-method-v1.0">Scientific Method v1.0</h1>
<p>Decide on a basic process of learning and use it on a hundred resources. In two days.</p>
<p>Actually do deliberate practice. Follow its principles.</p>
<p>Cure for despondency - fun failure. Work on hard projects rarely ever goes in vain. Plus, you get a powerful sense of agency.</p>
<h1 id="future-ideas">Future ideas</h1>
<p>What’s the bare minimum we can do to use Bayes Theorem in a domain?</p>
<p>Guess a model for how things work. Then, think hard to guess another way it could be. Look at their differing predictions and observe the actual outcome. How does this help get a model with high posterior probability? By looking at the differing predictions, we get strong evidence one way or another. We will reject one of the two hypotheses and become more confident in the other.</p>
<p>I think we should aim to run experiments next - manipulate some independent variables to see what happens. Always be looking for ways to test your beliefs.</p>
<p>Look for surprises. They are places where your current model is wrong. Note that this is basically a recipe for doing research.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Surprises are things that you not only didn’t know, but that contradict things you thought you knew. And so they’re the most valuable sort of fact you can get.</p>
<p>– Paul Graham, <a href>The Age of the Essay</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do we “learn” a causal model from some resource? What would that look like? Would we memorize the predictions or the core engine that generates those predictions? I need concrete examples for this.</p>
<p>In cases where the resource provides both the causal model and some tests, you can check for yourself if you can generate predictions correctly. In more vague cases, you would need to build the precise causal model yourself based on the evidence provided.</p>
<p>When you taboo some term (like “causal model”), provide three concrete examples to really drive it in.</p>
<p>Don’t just ask what something is. Also ask what it is not! Look at what could falsify your hypothesis. If you say “if Y, then X”, think of some Y that doesn’t lead to X.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-learn-a-causal-model">How to learn a causal model</h1>
<p>Maybe take some resource, maybe a book chapter or essay, and condense it till you have the shortest amount of words that can still make the same predictions as the original.</p>
<p>Basically, how do we test whether we’ve extracted an accurate causal model? We make sure it can precisely explain all the correlations we observed before. So, make a list up front of the observed correlations in some particular resource. Identify the variables you care about. What can you observe? These are your dependent variables. What can you manipulate? These are your independent variables.</p>

<h2 id="pgs-inequality-and-risk">PG’s Inequality and Risk</h2>
<p>Only two ways to reduce economic inequality - give money to the poor or take it from the rich.</p>
<p>[Translation: give money to poor -&gt; wealth of poor; take it from the rich -&gt; wealth of rich; wealth of poor, wealth of rich -&gt; economic inequality]</p>
<p>If you want to give money to the poor, you have to get it from somewhere; you can’t get it from the poor, so you have to get it from the rich.</p>
<p>[Translation: get money from rich -&gt; give money to poor; get money from poor -&gt; give money to poor (not much money here)]</p>
<p>Therefore, giving money to the poor means taking it away from the rich, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>[because there are no other causal links from get money from rich or to give money to poor.]</p>
<p>If you help the poor become more productive, they would become richer, but the rich wouldn’t become poorer.</p>
<p>[Translation: do stuff (education, etc.) -&gt; productivity of poor -&gt; wealth of poor]</p>
<p>However, making the poor more productive won’t reduce economic inequality, because it makes the rich richer too. Why? Because if there are more rich poor people, there are more workers and customers for the rich people.</p>
<p>[Translation: productivity of poor -&gt; more workers -&gt; wealth of rich; wealth of poor -&gt; customers -&gt; wealth of rich;]</p>
<h2 id="steve-yegges-the-emacs-problem">Steve Yegge’s The Emacs Problem</h2>
<p>When you write in Lisp, you don’t need to have configuration files that need special-processing. You can write them in Lisp, and use the full power of the language.</p>
<p>Why do people rave about the power of separating code and data? Because they’re using languages that can’t do a good job of representing code as data. (why can’t those languages do that?)</p>
<p>[Translating the above into variables: language -&gt; how well they represent code as data -&gt; do you feel like raving about the power of separating code and data.</p>
<p>He says that most current languages can’t do a good job here, and so that means their users will rave about the power of separating code and data. But why? It can’t be that if your product doesn’t do a good job of something you will rave about the opposite (or can it)? I think we need to specify some more variables between the not-good-job bit and the raving bit. Maybe it’s to do with the commitment and consistency effect - where you start valuing something more just because you’re doing it (though I’m not sure of the precise relationship).]</p>
<p>Why does he say people really want to represent code as data? Because the half-languages for configuration are all creeping towards Turing-completeness.</p>
<p>[Translation: how expressive you want the configuration language to be (A) -&gt; Turing-completeness of configuration language (B); A -&gt; representing code as data or not.]</p>
<h2 id="steve-yegges-practicing-programming">Steve Yegge’s Practicing Programming</h2>
<p>Don’t read this blog if someone is insisting that you read it. Wait until you really think you want to get better at programming. Why? Homework just seems to kill the desire to learn. (why?)</p>
<p>[Translation: homework -&gt; read blog, desire to learn; desire to learn -&gt; read blog; desire to learn, read blog -&gt; how much you learn;]</p>
<p>Merely doing your job everyday doesn’t qualify as real practice. Because you have to set aside some time once in a while and do focused practice in order to get better at something.</p>
<p>[Translation: how you do your job -&gt; time, focussed practice -&gt; performance]</p>
<p>Why are the great engineers as good as they are? Because they practice all the time.</p>
<p>[Translation: how much they practice -&gt; skill level of the great engineers]</p>
<h2 id="defining-property-by-paul-graham">Defining Property by Paul Graham</h2>
<p>People are enjoying music and movies without paying for them. The record labels and the movie studios argue that they own the music and that thus people are stealing the music and movies.</p>
<p>[pay -&gt; get goods and services “steal” -&gt; get goods and services “own music”, pay -&gt; should get money from it (how much?) “own music” and people “steal” -&gt; you won’t get much money You aren’t getting much money, but you “own” the music; therefore, people are “stealing”; But, another possibility is that you don’t “own” the music. ]</p>
<p>Thinking of treating smells as property sounds ridiculous to PG. Why? Because it “won’t work” to treat smells as property. Why?</p>
<p>When could we charge for smells?</p>
<p>If it works to treat something as property, you may count it as property.</p>
<p>Hunter gatherers didn’t treat land as property the way we do. (why?)</p>
<p>The definition of property changes very slowly (why?). So, people think it has a single, unchanging definition.</p>
<p>With the arrival of networks, data moves much faster and cheaper (how?).</p>
<p>Wishful thinking and short-term greed -&gt; labels and studios are accusing us all of stealing (as opposed to accepting it and doing something else with the new technology; but will any business owner really do that?)</p>
<p>driven by bonuses, not equity; therefore, try to extract money from stuff they do already.</p>
<p>are you saying that if they were driven by equity, they would behave otherwise? What about newspaper owners and stuff?</p>
<p>When people can charge for content without “warping society” to do it, we should allow them to charge for it.</p>
<p>The crazy legal measures that the labels and studios have been taking seem like warping society. What newspapers and magazines are doing don’t.</p>
<p>if you’re using a definition of property that doesn’t work you would be lobbying for laws that would break the internet, etc.</p>
<p>if you have working democracies and multiple sovereign countries, people can’t easily buy laws making the definition of property whatever they want it to be; not so with a single, autocratic government.</p>
<p>No single point of attack for people trying to warp the law -&gt; people running the US don’t like it; but it’s in our interest. Why? Because private property is an extremely useful idea - arguably one of our greatest inventions. (but exactly how useful is it?)</p>
<p>So far, each new definition of private property has brought more material wealth. (why?)</p>
<p>seems reasonable to suppose that new ones will too - why? Because things that have happened regularly before will probably continue</p>
<p>if just a few powerful people were too lazy to upgrade, we would have to keep running an obsolete version, which would be a disaster (how?)</p>
<hr />
<p>My analysis: You treat something as private property when it is rival and excludable (why should it be rival?). However, you can enact laws to artificially make something excludable - like in the case of piracy laws - even when the service is no longer intrinsically excludable (music and movies after data transfer became cheap). So, now what? Should you allow artificial exclusion or not? What are the costs and benefits?</p>

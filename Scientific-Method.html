<p><strong>Questions</strong>: How can we think scientifically? Perhaps design thinking would be more useful.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>What is a causal model? How does it deal with reductionism and empiricism?</p>
<p>Why is a causal model so important? Claim: You cannot get high predictive power without a causal model. Who doesn’t have it? Can we do without it? What about people in design?</p>
<p>How can you test if someone has a good causal model or not?</p>
<p>Science is about getting a good causal model. How exactly does science help us build a good causal model of some domain? What are the individual skills? How is it related to the ideal way of thinking?</p>
<p>What are some sources of cheap evidence? Learning and experimentation.</p>
<h1 id="causal-model">Causal Model</h1>
<p>Science is all about getting an accurate causal model of some domain, I think.</p>
<p>Having a causal model is not optional. Without it you just have a bunch of predictions, so you will be severely penalized when you’re asked about a different random experiment. This is also what Eliezer was talking about in Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions. You need to have a causal model making the predictions. That is why everything will become super-clear and there will be no more confusion. For you will be able to see <em>everything</em>!</p>
<p>State-transition model is key here. Your hypothesis doesn’t just work with variables (dependent or independent or whatever). It works with the entire state. In the future, if I look at some other variable, your hypothesis should make correct predictions.</p>
<p>Science is so powerful because when you do get it right, you understand exactly how the states of the world unfold. There is no more mystery. You know how the system generates each of the variables you perceive. You also know how it will behave even after you change a bunch of parts inside it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Science doesn’t work by waving wands and chanting spells, it works by knowing how the universe works on such a deep level that you know exactly what to do in order to make the universe do what you want.</p>
<p>– Harry Potter, <a href>HPMOR Chapter 7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why do we care about having a causal model? Because the more you can predict how something behaves, the more you can tweak it to do what you want at low cost.</p>
<p>Note that this is why you need to do a literature review before you go and do some new research. You need to understand the old causal model before you propose any extensions to it.</p>
<p>Note: All your explanations have to be mundane and completely specified - you can’t have mysterious parts in your causal model. You should ideally be able to write your hypothesis as a computer program. (Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions)</p>
<h1 id="causal-model-in-design">Causal Model in Design?</h1>
<p>How does this affect the question about using the scientific method in other domains, like design? Is the causal model really complicated in those areas? Well, you can always approximate it. The point that you can’t use anything but the scientific method still stands.</p>
<p>Now the question arises: in what language do you express the causal model? It is a program that you use to generate predictions for different experiments. Which language do you use?</p>
<p>Also, what you’re trying to do is approximate the actual working of the system, which is described completely in terms of interactions between atoms or quantum fields or whatever. That hypothesis is too huge for us to generate and too complex for us to handle, so we make some simplifying assumptions and build hypotheses on top of them. But the general principle stands, the closer you get to the actual algorithm that the universe is using to generate its states, the more predictive power you will have.</p>
<h1 id="building-a-causal-model">Building a Causal Model</h1>
<p>Building a causal model, I suspect, is nothing but programming.</p>
<p>In computer programming, we use a well-understood programming language to describe a process that will give us the behaviour we want. Thankfully, computers can use our descriptions to create the processes in real life.</p>
<p>In science, as I understand it, we use a less well-defined language to describe real-world processes. And because the language isn’t well-defined, computers can’t instantiate the processes we describe. Perhaps the domains here are more complex than those that computer programs deal with, so it’s harder to describe it well.</p>
<p>However, if we understand the language of the domain reasonably well, we may be able to use the powerful techniques of computer programming here and leverage them to make faster progress. Also, if we understand the domain well enough, we may be able to design new and more powerful languages.</p>
<h1 id="fundamental-questions-of-science">Fundamental Questions of Science</h1>
<p>The core question is: do you have a causal model that generates predictions?</p>
<p>(You can think of this as a hypothesis: “I have a causal model about this domain”. The following experiments will test whether you really do.)</p>
<p>If you can’t handle changed conditions, you don’t really have a causal model. If you can’t explain why exactly you predicted this particular outcome, not another, you don’t really have a causal model.</p>
<p>What will happen if I change the conditions? Can your hypothesis handle the new case? Is your hypothesis a causal description or just a bunch of predictions for some specific cases? The fundamental question here is similar to that in programming - can you handle change? If you try to encode each of the special cases (what will happen if X happens, if Y happens, etc.), then your hypothesis will become very large and get penalized for complexity. You have to extract a common causal model that generates all of those special cases parsimoniously.</p>
<p>To help you see what conditions to change, use taboo. See through the labels that seem meaningful to you and talk in terms of the territory. Don’t say “food”, say “an apple” or “a rotting chicken leg”.</p>
<p>Another way to know if you really have a causal model: why do you predict exactly this particular outcome? Why not some other one? You should have a good explanation for why the world ended up in this state and not another. Your causal model should generate precisely this outcome. Else, all you have is just a prediction, and when your hypothesis is questioned about a different experiment, it will have nothing useful to say and thus get downshifted. “Fertilizer makes plants grow bigger” - why doesn’t it make plants grow smaller? Why did you pick an arbitrary position?</p>
<p>Next, why are you running this <em>particular</em> experiment? What is the alternative hypothesis? Is this the most informative differing prediction from your hypothesis?</p>
<p>Is your hypothesis technical? What does it forbid?</p>
<p>Look at alternative hypotheses. You will be surprised by how often you can’t even think of one.</p>
<p>Where are you not getting the results you want? You have the wrong hypotheses there.</p>
<p>How can you falsify your current hypothesis? Raise strong alternative hypotheses.</p>
<h1 id="scientific-thinking-skills">Scientific Thinking skills</h1>
<h2 id="sources-of-evidence">Sources of Evidence</h2>
<p>I can’t hope to apply the scientific method by myself in the natural sciences. Evidence in those areas is costly. In psychology, for instance, I need to test a lot of people and do a lot of replications before I can be confident.</p>
<p>So, where is evidence not too costly?</p>
<p>In programming! You have the program and its source code. You can test it however you want and you can automate it too. In short, these days, you have some of the cheapest evidence ever! You can run your tests every five minutes to tell you if something is broken. How’s that for cheap and fast evidence?</p>
<p>Other areas of design too seem to have cheap evidence. In painting, you can use your own taste to judge different variations. Places like business and writing and so on also seem to have cheaper forms of evidence than the natural sciences. However, getting feedback from others is still a bottleneck. In music or art or architecture, you have to survey a lot of people to get a good idea of what they will like.</p>
<p>That is the biggest advantage of programming: you have to ask only the computer, not other people. And the computer is a dumb, obedient, cheap, and automatable source of feedback.</p>
<p>In short, there seem to be two sources of evidence: learning from others and experimenting on your own. By learning from others - asking people or reading books or journal papers or websites - you get evidence secondhand. By running experiments - on nature, on others, on yourself - you get evidence firsthand. Secondhand evidence is often vastly cheaper than firsthand evidence.</p>
<h2 id="ideas-for-scientific-method-domain-from-hpmor">Ideas for Scientific Method Domain (from HPMOR)</h2>
<p>(Note: This is just a v1.0 list. Keep updating it with time.)</p>
<p>If you come across some strange or awesome thing, ask if you know its causal structure.</p>
<p>If Y is an important subject, test out predictions about its various <em>properties</em>. How much low-hanging fruit is left? How much power does this concept have?</p>
<p>If you come across a new fact (aka some experiment + outcome), check it against your theories. Is it not possible? Raise huge alarms. Do your theories make any interesting inferences about it?</p>
<p>If you come across a new fact (experiment + outcome), update on that evidence</p>
<p>If you see X doing Y, ask why. (X could be you)</p>
<p>If you see X have a property Y, ask why. (X could be you)</p>
<p>If you see experiment Y happen to X, ask why. (X could be you)</p>
<p>If someone gives you a new hypothesis, ask for evidence.</p>
<p>If someone (including you) claims to have property X, test it out.</p>
<p>If you suspect Y exists, test it out.</p>
<p>If you think you have learned technique Y, test it out.</p>
<p>If you think you have learned concept Y, test it out.</p>
<p>If you want to make Y happen, come up with a state of the world that leads to Y (according to your hypothesis).</p>
<p>Can Y happen? Check if your hypothesis predicts that the current state will lead to Y.</p>
<p>In some new / confusing area, why doesn’t ~Y happen?</p>
<p>If you see some object Y, where does Y come from? Why did the world go from some past state to Y?</p>
<p>If you see some fact of the world Y, ask what caused Y to be like that. example: historical stuff like democracy, markets, etc.</p>
<p>If you strongly believe some causal model is true, ask what would it take to convince you otherwise? Always be looking for ways to test your beliefs.</p>
<p>If you see X do some awesome thing Y, ask <em>how</em> X does Y.</p>
<h2 id="the-scientific-method-in-short-and-in-theory">The Scientific Method: In short, and in theory</h2>
<p>Outcome =&gt; Update on Evidence - enumerate the hypotheses that might matter</p>
<p>Random Experiment =&gt; Generate Hypotheses using the possible outcomes</p>
<p>Also, Generate Experiment =&gt; Modify the state so that it distinguishes between two hypotheses</p>
<p>Information to maintain: list of major hypotheses (per domain), list of special hypotheses, list of evidence (per domain), list of strange evidence. Types of values you can find: experiments, outcomes, hypotheses, predictions, and domains. Domain = set of experiments, I think.</p>
<p>Feedback: Get it from your predictions for various Random Experiments.</p>
<p>Heuristics and Biases: You also need to learn to overcome the biases in your mind.</p>
<p>What about essay-writing as a means of getting to the truth? How does that work exactly? How does that compare to a scientific paper?</p>
<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<p>Empiricism is one of the most important skills. I need to distinguish between the map and the territory and always seek empirical evidence. Next, I need to think in terms of anticipation-constraints instead of mere words. Then, I need to maintain hypotheses explicitly and update them on evidence. Lastly, I need to run hypothesis tests that distinguish well between my hypotheses.</p>
<p>We routinely fail to notice what our beliefs forbid (if they do at all). That was the whole point of Eliezer’s sequence on Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions. If you predict that something will happen, you are necessarily predicting that the other thing will not. Also, we avoid testing our beliefs. We like to stay comfortable. Then, we also fail to collect empirical evidence - we just go by our naive thoughts. Even when we decide to think scientifically, we may not choose the most informative hypothesis tests.</p>
<p>Right now, I’m hitting a block because there seem to be so many things you can do (on the same sentence) and I don’t know where to start. Ok, Rapid Prototyping 101 - build a bare minimum hello world version. What can I not release without? I can deal with empiricism later. Anticipation-constraining is important, but right now I need something that will do work that cannot be replaced, a sine qua non if you will. What makes the scientific method the scientific method is the idea of differing predictions between hypotheses. Even the Bayesian updating on evidence can be done later. But testing things experimentally is the unique core of science, I think.</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>It’s the products we really care about, not the research that leads to it. If you could somehow magically get a new, fast, safe flying vehicle without doing any sort of research for it, you would grab it instantly. We care about research to the extent that it leads to useful products.</p>
<p>So why aren’t scientists working directly on products? Why do we have people working on pure research, apparently divorced from the practical side of things?</p>
<h2 id="science-and-programming">Science and Programming</h2>
<p>Still, hypotheses are programs. If science is about formulating and testing hypotheses, how can you do that without writing programs (in whatever language)?</p>
<p>Writing programs would force you to be explicit about your ideas and would probably resolve most “debates”. The point is, right now scientists are dealing with implicit programs - models in their head or maybe stuff written out in technical jargon. Can we do better?</p>
<h2 id="essays-and-causal-models">Essays and Causal Models</h2>
<p>Essays are about getting a good causal model of the subject. Essay writers may not use the scientific method explicitly, but the end is much the same. You don’t just talk about the topic on the surface, you dig deeper. You posit causes for the phenomena you see. You may not be doing it rigorously, but if you have a lot of experience in the domain, you will hit the target more often than not. Paul Graham is a great example in the domain of startups and programming languages and writing.</p>
<p>You can’t write a good essay without positing a causal model, I suspect. We might find it awkward to read an essay without a “because”. We might find it empty and without substance. An easy test: compare essays with usual internet blog posts. I find the latter to be utterly devoid of substance. I predict that the blog posts I find to be shallow and empty will not present any causal model of the subject they’re talking about. Let me stick my neck out further: I predict that bad writing will not present any causal model, period.</p>
<p>Yes, good writing needs style, too. That may even be half the work of writing, as PG says, but I think positing a cause for the phenomena you see is the first business of essay writing. Remember, an essay has to be true before it is beautiful. All considerations of beauty and style come after we have decided the questions of fact.</p>
<p>PG is already ahead of the curve here (again). He says that he writes essays with the sole purpose of figuring things out. What is that but getting a good causal model of a subject? Even more importantly, he consciously aims for maximum surprise! That is, he wants to come up with hypotheses that differ from conventional ones in ways that matter.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In short, I suspect that essay-writing is just scientific thinking in disguise. There may be no explicit hypothesis testing or rigorous use of empirical evidence, but at the end of the day, you are still positing causes for things and trying to reject those ruled out by evidence.</p>
<p>This tells us how we might optimize essay-writing. The closer we can get to scientific thinking, by being more empirical with the evidence we collect and using probabilities where we can and making our hypotheses more falsifiable, the better our ideas (and thus our essays) will be.</p>
<h2 id="sidenote-science-vs-design">Sidenote: Science vs Design?</h2>
<p>One of my beliefs right now is that if we started thinking more scientifically, we would solve a lot more problems quickly. I need to drill down to the core of this and find out exactly when (or if) this is true, and how far scientific thinking can help me.</p>
<p>Let us look at the conventional hypothesis I differ from. How else do people suggest you should think?</p>
<p>In the sciences, they mostly already use the scientific method. So, we have no difference there. Where do people not use the scientific method? In programming, for example. In businesses too, I believe. In the arts - writing, singing, composing, acting, etc. When people are designing things, I think they tend not to use the scientific method directly (this is a testable prediction).</p>
<p>So, my hypothesis is that the scientific method is great for figuring out the rules in a domain - why something behaves the way it does. Once you roughly know the rules, I think you tend to use a different kind of process to design things.</p>
<p>In programming, you know the core rules of your language. And now you want to build a program that satisfies certain criteria. Hmmm… the problem is you don’t really know the final program you want. You cannot visualize all the requirements in your head, they are too numerous. Plus, they keep changing over time. So, maybe what you’re uncertain about here isn’t the working of the language, it’s what you want to build and how you want to build it.</p>
<p>The same holds for other areas of design, I think. In writing, you may know the basic rules of grammar, but you’re unsure about what you really want to say and how you want to say it. Similarly for composing music or painting, I suppose.</p>
<p>In physics, chemistry, and the other sciences, the problem was that we humans were unsure about the rules of the domain itself. We didn’t know how exactly gravity worked, or which chemicals would combine to do what, or what each part of our body did. The main aim there was to discover the rules of the domain - the laws of physics, the properties of chemicals, the anatomy of the human body.</p>
<p>If the scientific method (or Bayesian thinking) is theoretically the most efficient way of getting correct knowledge about the world, why do we not use it when designing things? Is it because of our cognitive limitations? Or is the nature of the problem itself different from those in physics or chemistry? In short, is there a difference between reduction and creation?</p>
<p>When designing, it is not the rules you’re unsure of, it is the product you want to design. You are unsure of the exact combination of building blocks that will pass the feedback test. You are even unsure of the exact feedback test you should use. In most projects, both the product and the feedback mechanism used evolve over time.</p>
<p>However, just because you’re unsure about a different thing doesn’t mean you should change the reasoning you use to get to the answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just because I’m ignorant about the universe doesn’t mean that I’m unsure about how I should reason in the presence of my uncertainty. The laws for thinking with probabilities are no less iron than the laws that govern old-fashioned logic</p>
<p>– Harry Potter, <a href>HPMOR Chapter 17</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think we should use the scientific method no matter what we are uncertain about. Perhaps we can use some approximations if our mind can’t handle the full-blown thing.</p>
<p>What is the difference, though, between a usual science problem and a design problem? You have more control over the subject in the latter. In programming, for instance, you deal with something that is completely man-made, you have as much control as you want over the behaviour of the system. Perhaps this means there are far more variables to control for. There may be too much information to hold in your head - like when working on very large programs. Similarly, you may find it hard to make changes. It may also be really hard to come up with hypotheses in the first place.</p>
<p>However, that doesn’t mean you can just go ahead and do whatever you want. There is a right way to think under uncertainty, and every other way of thinking will be provably worse. If you don’t use the laws of probability to think, how else will you decide what to do?</p>
<p>That is the core of my argument here. There is a right way of thinking under uncertainty, and whenever we deviate or choose an ad hoc path, we will do worse. Of course, we may not be able to think perfectly, but even given our bounded resources, I claim that we can do better.</p>
<p>Insofar as our thought processes mimic the right way, you will get good results. We need not be fully conscious of what we’re doing. So, the aim isn’t to deliberately think in a scientific way at each step. The aim is to make our thought processes hew as closely to the ideal way of thinking as possible.</p>
<p>How do we make our thought processes match the ideal way of thinking as much as possible, in a variety of concrete domains?</p>
<h2 id="taboo-no-magic-numbers">Taboo: No magic numbers</h2>
<p>In programming, we have a rule: your code should not have any magic numbers embedded in it. The statement <code>return foo * 25;</code> will be dismissed immediately by any decent programmer. Why? Because there is no apparent reason for the existence of 25. Why is it 25, why not 26 or 24? It may represent the number of students in a class, but suppose next semester the number of students changes, how are you supposed to know what to change?</p>
<p>Similarly, your hypothesis should not have any magic numbers embedded in it. “Cockroaches are sensitive to electromagnetic radiation of frequency 50Hz” - that should raise a red flag immediately. Why are you talking about 50Hz? Why not 60Hz or 174Hz? What will happen in those cases? Sadly, your “hypothesis” doesn’t say anything there. A good hypothesis would tell us exactly how the behaviour of the cockroach changes with electromagnetic radiation, and so help us calculate its response for a range of frequencies.</p>
<p>Along the same line, your hypothesis should not have any unjustified magic effects. “If a plant receives fertilizer, then it will grow to be bigger than a plant that doesn’t receive fertilizer” - why are you talking about fertilizers in particular? Do you have any causal model that tells you <em>how</em> fertilizers will help plants grow bigger? Yes, you may have observed fertilizer helping plants several times, but that should just leave you puzzled because you have no clue why it is happening that way. For example, what will happen if I dump double the amount of fertilizer? Will the growth double? What if I only add a tiny bit, will the growth diminish?</p>
<p>What if I change the type of fertilizer - instead of phosphate, what if I use ammonia or whatever (I’m just pulling these out of my ass)? In fact, what makes a “fertilizer”? “Fertilizer” is just a label that people put on certain chemicals. What if you had a box labelled “Poison” and you give it to the plant and their growth doubled, would you say that Poison makes plants grow?</p>
<p>Let me resolve the confusion. We need to taboo key terms in our hypothesis so that we understand exactly why things are happening. Don’t use the term “electromagnetic radiation”: “Cockroaches are sensitive to qnthla” - see how silly that sounds? It doesn’t explain anything. In fact, go ahead and taboo “cockroaches” and “sensitive” too. Now, you’re forced to explain exactly how the radiation burns their antenna (or whatever; I’m making this up because I Am Not A Biologist) and how they try to escape antenna-burning. Now, you have several fronts on which this hypothesis is testable, all the better for it to be accepted strongly if it emerges unscathed. You might find some other species whose antenna is sensitive to radiation, or you can try some other ways of burning their antenna, whatever.</p>
<p>In short, don’t write your hypotheses in a natural language like English. Write them in the technical language of the domain, where you can’t escape out of tough situations by just hand-waving or using suggestive names.</p>
<p>(Thanks to Dr Paul Strode who taught me the difference between research hypotheses and mere predictions - <a href="https://mrdrscienceteacher.wordpress.com/2014/11/02/teaching-the-hypothesis/">web page</a>; <a href="http://www.collegedevelopmentnetwork.ac.uk/download-document/6016-difference-between-a-hypothesis-and-a-prediction">great presentation</a>)</p>
<h2 id="testing-my-conception-of-science-v1.0">Testing my Conception of Science v1.0</h2>
<p>I’ll test my idea of a hypothesis on the list of example “hypotheses” provided by Dr. Paul Strode.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is hypothesized that a forefoot strike pattern will correlate with lower ground reaction forces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What happens when you do some other strike pattern? Will you get lower or higher ground reaction? I can’t see a causal model here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is hypothesized that the structural and functional integrity of the system as a whole is dependent on nerve activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cool. But that still doesn’t help me make any predictions. It is as vague as you can get. What happens if there is a lot of nerve activity? What happens if there is very little nerve activity?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We aimed to test the hypothesis of whether young healthy women will increase muscle mass and lose fat mass after undergoing 12 wk of intense resistance training (Josse et al. 2010).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This just a method followed by a prediction. Why would intense resistance training make you increase muscle mass and lose fat mass? What if I did light resistance training? Would I gain a lot more muscle or a lot less muscle? What if I did it for 50 weeks instead of 12? What about just 1 week? What results will I see? Your “hypothesis” does nothing to answer these questions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If food is present in the aquarium, then snails will move with greater speed (toward the food) (Green 2004).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is just a prediction. What if you place no food, just the smell of it? What if you place dummy food? Wait. Taboo “food”. What if you place a tasty burger? What if you place a rotting dog corpse? Will the snails still move with the same gusto?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aspirin inhibits key oncogenic factors and/ or activates pivotal tumor suppressor genes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah. This is getting closer and closer to a causal model. You can test this in several ways - make somebody eat aspirin, maybe inject them with aspirin (is that possible?), or do something else that reliably increases aspirin content in the brain. All of those should work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a plant receives fertilizer, then they will grow to be bigger than a plant that doesn t receive fertilizer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a prediction, without a precise method or hypothesis. How much fertilizer? Of what kind? For how many days? What will happen if I change any of those parameters - will the plant grow more or less? You need to answer the “why” of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marsh grass growth is limited by available nitrogen (Miller and Levine 2010).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is close to a causal model. It predicts a lot - you can test it by keeping nitrogen level constant and increasing everything else (growth shouldn’t be affected, because nitrogen is the limiting factor); you can test it by increasing the nitrogen level. Of course, it would be better if it explained exactly how nitrogen affects growth, which might help us figure out the exact relation between growth and nitrogen level.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the farmer burns the prairie then the next year will produce taller plants in his field then the previous year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just a method followed by prediction. Why is the burning of the prairie connected to the height of the plants? What if you burn some other part of the farm? What if you burn stuff, grow something else for a year, and then grow another crop - will they be taller than usual? And so on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on this observation, we hypothesized that natural selection may have influenced AMY1 copy number in certain human populations (Perry et al. 2007).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why is AMY1 present? Why isn’t it absent? Which specific human populations does your model predict will have this thing? Why them? Why not others? What sort of fitness advantage does it give so that it keeps propagating itself? Why is it not in everybody?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fire is replenishing the nutrients in the soil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a decent causal model, but not very precise. What kind of nutrients? What kind of fire? How does it depend on the duration of the fire? What if you pour water immediately afterwards? Does it take time for the nutrients to get “replenished”? Do you have to wait till you start planting the crops? Where exactly do the nutrients go? What if I removed the top layer of the soil (or have a flood that does the same)? Can you replenish the nutrients some other way?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The foraging patterns of S. carpocapsae, as measured by directional response, are affected by electrical fields.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok. But how? What if you keep changing the intensity of the electrical fields? Do they revert when you stop the electrical field? What about other kinds of radiation? What about other species? Does your causal model predict why their foraging pattern (of all things) might be affected by electrical fields?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe resin content of various pine species will affect its energy output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok. But how exactly does the energy output vary with the resin content? Can you predict the relation across a wide variety of existing pine species? What if I introduce more resin into the tree? What if I remove the resin content (I’m talking out of my ass here, pardon me)? What if people genetically modify some pine species so that it has more resin content? Talking about cause, why do you predict that resin content will affect the energy output at all? What is your explanation for the link between the two?</p>

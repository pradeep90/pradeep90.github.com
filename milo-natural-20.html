<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>These are my notes from <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20">Harry Potter and the Natural 20</a>, a Harry Potter + Dungeons and Dragons crossover fanfic.</p>
<h1 id="the-gamer-mindset">The Gamer Mindset</h1>
<p>My hypothesis is that Milo Amastacia-Liadon, the protagonist, a D&amp;D character who suddenly finds himself in the Harry Potter world, is the epitome of all the traits that Jane McGonigal found in gamers.</p>
<p>He works ceaselessly and enjoys doing so (blissful productivity). He jumps at the chance to go on an adventure and believes he can overcome any challenge (urgent optimism). He builds strong alliances with his “raiding party” of Harry, Ron, and Hermione (social fabric?). And, finally, he’s on an epic mission to save the wizarding worlds, both the Harry Potter world and his own Myra (“City of Light! City of Magic!”), from evil forces.</p>
<p>Not just that, he’s also a masterful consequentialist. He only does those things that maximize his expected utility (or rather his XP). This is what single-minded focus looks like. This is what rationality looks like.</p>
<p>So, if you want to learn about working at the peak of your potential, thinking consequentially, and behaving strategically, Milo is your man.</p>
<h1 id="strategic-thinking-know-your-options">Strategic Thinking: Know your Options</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“All Milo had left was Silent Image, Feather Fall, Grease, and some cantrips.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you have the concrete options, you can compare them against each other and decide.</p>
<h1 id="practical-consequentialism">Practical Consequentialism</h1>
<p>He is a practical consequentialist, not just a theoretical one like me.</p>
<p>Look to maximize your utility function! Don’t do <em>anything</em> else.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Milo only bothered to go to the Great Hall for dinner (as opposed to munching on Everlasting Rations in his dorm) because he’d noticed a <em>correlation</em> between mealtimes there and having <em>important</em> conversations.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“I see,” Milo said. “that seems… <em>terribly mundane</em>, actually. Surely I didn’t get pulled out of compressed time for that?”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“She said she wanted to talk to me alone for a while,” Milo shrugged. “So I just assumed she had some <em>critical information</em> she has to pass along, or possibly a <em>magic item</em>. For all I know, she’ll give me a <em>quest</em>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“I am led to believe,” said Hermione Granger, sitting casually in an armchair, “that the Chudley Cannons went up against the Wigtown Wanderers this morning and actually won.”</p>
<p>“Wait, and this is supposed to be <em>important</em>?” Milo asked.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="urgent-optimism-look-forward-to-encounters">Urgent Optimism: Look forward to encounters!</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Milo was the only Gryffindor <strong>smiling</strong> when they entered Snape’s dungeon. Dungeon. It had been far too long since Milo had been in a proper dungeon, now all they needed was a troll or two to complete his day.</p>
<p>Milo didn’t know what, specifically, was going to go down in the dungeon. But he knew someone was going to start a fight, and he knew who was going to finish it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Look at that! Look at the enthusiasm with which he approaches his work! As opposed to us, who dread it.</p>
<p>Have faith that your <em>work</em> can be super-enjoyable. I’ve been acting like I need all these distractions, like YouTube videos or blogs or tasty junk food. Like I need a break from the tedious hard work I’m doing. But no. Your work can be fun too!</p>
<p>Have a singular utility function and change up things to keep yourself motivated. Have different kinds of quests. You can solve problems that need to be solved, read some awesome book (and make summaries), practice and build up your skill, make and review flashcards, write essays, and so on.</p>
<p>Life is (or can be) awesome! I’ve been acting like it’s a drag.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: Have shorter, sweeter quests.</p>
<p>I’ve been setting tasks that take hours and hours. Instead set up short 20-minute tasks (when it comes to deep work).</p>
<h1 id="fun-failure">Fun Failure</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Next time, he thought, make sure there’s a Potion of Cure Light Wounds in your Belt of Hidden Pouches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Look for lessons from every encounter.</p>
<h1 id="satisfying-work-always-have-a-quest">Satisfying Work: Always have a quest!</h1>
<p>Have a well-defined goal, feedback mechanism, and clear instructions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Anyways, regardless - there, happy? - of the meaning of character development, <em>sidequests</em> are brief excursions, more focussed on a single idea, generally simpler, and also where most of the best loot comes from.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="think-in-terms-of-causal-models">Think in terms of Causal Models</h1>
<p>Milo always uses the rules of the D&amp;D world to predict who will win in any situation. I need to do something similar for the real world and use the laws of economics, etc. to predict outcomes.</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>The ideas of urgent optimism, satisfying work, etc. are from Jane McGonigal’s book Reality is Broken and her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE1DuBesGYM">TED talk</a> “Gaming can make a better world”.</p>

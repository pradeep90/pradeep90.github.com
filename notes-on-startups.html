<h1 id="ideas-that-generally-fail">Ideas that generally fail</h1>
<p>Quora - What are some startup ideas that frequently fail? (<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-startup-ideas-that-frequently-fail">link</a>)</p>
<p><a href="http://autopsy.io/">Autopsy</a> - list of failed startups.</p>
<h1 id="founder-self-doubt">Founder Self-Doubt</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The job of a CEO is to pick up a task that nobody’s doing, and do it. You build yourself to a point that you’re really good at it, and then eventually you hire somebody and hand it off to them. So at any given point you’re never really good at anything, because once you are, you’re handing it off to someone else.</p>
<p>– <a href="http://www.themacro.com/articles/2016/01/interview-lumoid-aarthi-ramamurthy/">interview</a> with Aarthi Ramamurthy, Lumoid</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="startup-trends">Startup trends</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The grass may be greener on the startup side of the fence, but let’s be realistic: first, most people who play that game well end up as investors rather than founders, because whatever fun there might be in building a business is sucked out by having VCs as your boss, so it’s better to be investor-side than be a “founder” who is really (guess what) a <em>mid-level product manager in the Valley ecosystem</em>; second, most people who are throwing 70-hour weeks after uncertain startups, instead of in jobs like yours ($450k at Google) or in VC firms, are there involuntarily, trying to save their careers by packing on variance (which you don’t want, because you’re so far ahead).</p>
<p>… if you’re not clearly on a fast track after 2-4 years, you’ve been written off</p>
<p>– <a href="https://www.quora.com/Im-28-and-making-450-000-a-year-at-Google-I-love-my-job-and-everything-Ive-been-told-indicates-Im-on-the-fast-track-career-wise-Will-it-ever-make-sense-for-me-to-leave-for-a-startup/answer/Michael-O-Church">Investors and founders</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="failure">Failure</h1>
<p>Apparently, there’s something called FailCon. Check it out.</p>
<h1 id="user-validation">User Validation</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Good validation work would’ve looked something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hour-long interviews with professors and TAs diving into what they found most frustrating about teaching.</li>
<li>Digging and digging until we found a problem we could solve, or even more critically, possibly determining that there were no problems for us to solve.</li>
</ul>
<p>As engineers who had never done this before, talking to people didn’t seem like <em>real work</em>. Real work was coding. But in reality, <strong>20 hours of great interviews</strong> probably would’ve saved us an accrued 18 months of building useless stuff.</p>

<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/22/y-combinator-demo-day-winter-2016/">YC Winter 2016</a>. See for yourself and learn what the top startups look like.</p>
<h1 id="become-formidable">Become Formidable</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Become formidable. Also become <strong>tough</strong> - the road ahead is going to be painful and make you <strong>doubt yourself</strong> many, many times.</p>
<p>– Sam Altman, <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/startup-advice-briefly">Startup Advice, Briefly</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suspect the way to do that is through boundaries and knowing exactly how committed you are to a particular path and thus how much you’re willing to endure and give up for it.</p>

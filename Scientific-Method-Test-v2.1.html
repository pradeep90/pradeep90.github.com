<h1 id="chapter-three---too-tired-to-resist-why-self-control-is-like-a-muscle">Chapter Three - Too Tired to Resist: Why Self-Control Is Like A Muscle</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Correlation between exam week and various characteristics of students: energy levels, how much caffeine and sugar they consume, how much they exercise, how much they smoke, how healthy their food choices are, personal hygiene, etc. Apparently, things are different in the previous 10 weeks of college. Hypotheses: participation in exam week could cause these changes, or these changes could cause participation in exam week (no, exam week came first), or something could cause them both (but, your participation is decided at the start of the school year). So, participation in exam week must be causing these changes. But, it seems like a distant cause to me. Do other factors come in between?</p>
<p>Another correlation: “people who use their willpower tend to run out of it”. Actually, this is experimental evidence - you intervene and make them use their willpower, and then you find out that they have less of it. Variables: “how much” willpower they are able to exert, time.</p>
<p>Wait. Now that you put it in the form of a variable, it seems much more vague. How do we say that somebody has “run out of willpower”? How do we observe or manipulate this “willpower” thing? How can we measure how much willpower some task has used? I guess it’s about controlling your impulses, where “impulses” are judged so by humans because we don’t understand them well enough to describe them mathematically. Basically, doing stuff you don’t feel like doing, not doing stuff you feel like doing, and doing stuff that matches your goals regardless of how you feel about it.</p>
<p>“Smokers who go without a cigarette for twenty-four hours are more likely to binge on ice cream.” Variables: time without cigarette, % of binging on icecream. This was experimental evidence so time without cigarette caused % of binging on icecream.</p>
<p>“Drinkers who resist their favorite cocktail become physically weaker on a test of endurance.” Variables: say no when offered favourite cocktail, physical endurance. This too was experimental evidence.</p>
<p>“Perhaps most disturbingly, people who are on a diet are more likely to cheat on their spouse.” Variables: on a diet, % of cheaters. Experimental evidence here too.</p>
<p>Correlation between time of day and willpower: highest in the morning and steadily deteriorates over course of the day. (I suspect this is about the time passed since you woke up, not the objective time of the day.) Variables: time since awakening, willpower. Time since awakening is caused by the passage of time, nothing can affect that. So, the passage of time must be causing the decrease in willpower. I think what happens is that humans as living creatures think and act, which needs time, and these thoughts and actions deplete their willpower. That’s one hypothesis (H1). Another one (H2) is that the willpower in your mind is like a radioactive substance - it will decrease at some rate even if you don’t act.</p>
<p>So, how exactly do these hypotheses differ? Well, they differ in the direct causes of willpower. H1 says that willpower depletion depends purely on the actions you take (and they depend on time for their execution, but that doesn’t matter, that’s not a direct cause). H2 says that willpower depletion depends on actions as well as on the time elapsed - taking impulse-control action will deplete willpower but so will just the raw passage of time. We can think of a third hypothesis H3 that says willpower depletion depends only on the raw passage of time, no matter what actions you take.</p>
<p>H1 and H2 differ in the role of time; so, keep the actions the same but change the time elapsed - maybe do nothing at all for hours. H2 says that willpower should have decreased, while H1 begs to disagree. H2 and H3 (as also H1 and H3) differ in the role of actions; so, for the same time period, take lots of actions in one case and don’t do anything in the other case. H3 says that willpower will decrease by the same amount, H2 says it won’t.</p>
<p>Alternative hypothesis: virtue - you do crap because you suck. Variables: virtue, willpower. Virtue could be causing you to have willpower. So, the only cause of willpower is your virtue. Therefore, time or actions should not change willpower in any way. But, they do.</p>
<h2 id="the-muscle-model-of-self-control">The Muscle Model of Self-Control</h2>
<p>Roy Baumeister’s experimental evidence: No matter what willpower-exerting task he posed, he found that people’s willpower deteriorated over time. Variables: type of willpower-exerting task, whether willpower deteriorates over time. These were interventions, so we can generalize that willpower exertion is a direct cause of willpower depletion. So, in general, no matter what else you do, if you exert willpower, you will lose a corresponding amount of willpower. (Yes, in the future we may discover some intermediate variables between willpower exertion and depletion, which screen off the effect of exertion. But, for now, we know of nothing that will prevent the effect.)</p>
<p>Note, however that there are two possible hypotheses here. Willpower exertion on a task of one type could cause willpower depletion on the task of the same type, yet not change anything for other kinds of tasks. Call this H1. Alternatively, willpower exertion on any task could cause willpower depletion on any other task (H2). Basically, H1 says that willpower depletion on task of type A is caused only by willpower exertion on previous tasks of type A, whereas H2 says that willpower depletion on tasks of type A is caused by willpower exertion on any kind of task. H1 and H2 differ when the previous task is of some other type.</p>
<p>Also, a concentration task was followed by depleted physical strength. Variables: concentration, physical strength. So, concentration in the first task is correlated with depleted strength in the second. Either concentration is causing deployed strength or something is causing both. Well, what have we seen so far that causes decrease in strength (keeping other factors constant)? Willpower! So, concentration is depleting willpower for physical strength. This eliminates H1. There must be a common source of willpower for all kinds of tasks.</p>
<p>Denying yourself sweets was correlated by procrastination later. Variables: whether you accepted the sweets, how much you procrastinate</p>
<p>Correlation between pausing and planning and using up willpower.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-self-control-limited">Why is Self-Control Limited?</h2>
<p>Hypothesis: willpower exertion depends on brain energy?</p>
<p>Experiment: The more the blood sugar dropped after a self-control task, the worse the performance on the next task. So, willpower exertion caused blood sugar to drop (by how much?).</p>
<p>Also, they observed a correlation between blood sugar drop and performance on the next task. I’m not sure whether the correlation was about the absolute blood sugar level, % drop in blood sugar level, or absolute drop in blood sugar level. Also, if it’s about the drop in blood sugar level, what happens when you don’t have a change in your blood sugar level - how do you predict your willpower, then? Let’s just call it blood sugar drop for now.</p>
<p>Anyway, I suspect it is a correlation, not necessarily causation, because they didn’t manipulate the blood sugar level directly. So, the willpower exertion could have caused blood sugar to drop and also separately caused poorer performance on the next task (as has been observed before), or the blood sugar drop could have caused poorer performance. (Poorer performance on the second task could not have caused blood sugar drop because it came afterwards.)</p>
<p>How do these hypotheses differ? Both say that blood sugar drop is caused by willpower exertion. No difference there. Next, the first one says that performance on a self-control task (aka available willpower) depends only on prior willpower exertion. But, the second one says willpower depends only on blood sugar level (which in turn depends on willpower exertion). If we try to test by exerting willpower, both will predict the same decrease in willpower, because exertion will decrease blood sugar level and therefore decrease willpower. However, if you change the blood sugar level alone, then the first hypothesis predicts that nothing should change regarding available willpower. (Remember, however, that we aren’t yet clear about what “blood sugar level” means - it could be the relative change in blood sugar, or the absolute change, or the absolute level).</p>
<p>Experiment: for willpower-drained participants, boosting blood sugar level (using a sugar drink) caused self-control to increase. (Not sure exactly by how much, though.)</p>
<p>How much did you need to increase the blood sugar level? Why did you need a full glass of sugary lemonade?</p>
<p>And we’ve seen earlier that there is some internal store of willpower that somehow decides how much self-control you can exert. So, if blood sugar level allows you to exert more self-control, it must be doing so by determining the amount of willpower you have.</p>
<p>Correlation: people with low blood sugar are more likely to rely on stereotypes.</p>
<p>Experiment: giving participants a sugar boost causes them to be more persistent and less impulsive.</p>
<h3 id="confusion">Confusion</h3>
<p>Wait. So, what is the overall picture here? Exerting willpower causes blood sugar to drop. But, somehow your blood sugar level determines the amount of willpower available to you. It’s like you can’t use a lot of willpower if your blood sugar level is low.</p>
<p>How exactly does the “amount of willpower” you have determine your success at self-control in a task? Is it that if your willpower is very low, you won’t be able to do some tasks at all, no matter how hard you try? Or will you not even try? Does it depend on the intensity of the self-control needed?</p>
<p>The reason we need to be careful here is that “willpower” is not directly observable or manipulable. What we know about it is that exerting self-control decreases it and that when it is low, you can’t exert much self-control. However, neither of those links are precise. How much some task decrease your willpower? What does the exact amount depend on - the intensity of the task, how much you like it, and so on? Similarly, how does your ability to exert self-control depend on the amount of willpower?</p>

<p>Willpower is like a muscle - use it and you lose it. Willpower is limited due to the energy available to your brain.</p>
<h1 id="lessons">Lessons</h1>
<p>Taboo the variables. For example, what does “self-control” really imply? What tasks demand that of you? Does concentration require self-control? Does some physical activity require it?</p>
<p>When considering whether A can cause B, ask about the possible known causes of B. If some other factor unrelated to A is known to determine B, then A cannot cause B, directly or indirectly. The same goes when asking whether something can cause both A and B.</p>
<p>When someone poses a new hypothesis, ask what factors they say <em>won’t</em> affect some variable (directly). For example, the virtue theory of willpower says that time or action won’t affect willpower, whereas the willpower as muscle theory says that actions will affect willpower but virtue probably won’t. This gives us easy distinguishing tests.</p>
<p>So, don’t talk about what affects X. Talk about what <em>doesn’t</em> affect X - the things that are not direct causes.</p>
<p>An experiment basically tells you that the intervention A is a cause of the dependent variable B. So, barring independent variables that come between A and B, no matter what else we change, if you change A, then B will change accordingly.</p>
<p>Keep your variables narrow. For example, willpower available for tasks of type A need not be the same as that for tasks of type B. It just so happens that it is.</p>

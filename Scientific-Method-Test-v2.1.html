<h1 id="scientific-method-v2.1">Scientific Method v2.1</h1>
<p>Here’s my v2.0 algorithm: Collect evidence, come up with small alternative models, and combine those into big models.</p>
<p>Resource: The Will Power Instinct, by Kelly McGonigal</p>
<p>Mission: Summarize the Introduction chapter of the book.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Correlation: Most people say that they want more willpower - to be in control of every aspect of their lives; but most people feel like willpower failures. So, we have a correlation between wanting willpower and not having willpower. Maybe wanting willpower causes you to not have willpower (and not wanting it causes you to have it), not having willpower causes you to want it, or something else causes both.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the variable “wanting more willpower”. What could cause it? Of course, if you had complete self-control, you wouldn’t want more willpower. So, how much willpower you have is a factor. Your goals matter too - if all you had to do was keep eating some kind of healthy, tasty chocolate as many times as you wanted, you wouldn’t need too much willpower. Basically, are your goals against your impulses? So, whether you want more willpower depends on how much willpower you have and what your goals are.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at the variable “feeling like a willpower failure”. What could cause this? Again, I think this is determined by your goals and how much willpower you were able to exert. Maybe this happens when you fail miserably - when you fall badly for temptations. That is, % of times you’ve fallen for temptations.</p>
<p>Correlation: Most people say that lack of willpower is the main reason they struggle with goals. That is, most people say that lack of self-control causes low % success in their goals. One implication is that if you increase self-control somehow, you would achieve more success. Also, if you decreased it somehow, you would achieve less success. But how exactly does self-control cause success in their goals? What can self-control do? It can help you overcome impulses and keep out distractions. What causes success, in general? Doing what is needed and not doing what is harmful. Well, self-control will be crucial here only if you can’t succeed without controlling your impulses. So, maybe we only call those things as goals that we can’t accomplish by default, things that go against our instincts. Therefore, success in goals depends on self-control because our goals run against our impulses.</p>
<p>Correlation: People continue to rely on wrongheaded strategies for self-control, despite scientific research that might help them. % of people, effectiveness of common strategies, effectiveness of scientifically-studied strategies</p>
<p>Survey results after four weeks: 97% felt they better understood their own behaviour; 84% felt they had got more willpower due to the class. Time elapsed in the course, % who feel they’ve better understood their own behaviour, % that feel they’ve got more willpower.</p>
<p>Correlation: People felt the insights were useful for varied challenges. Type of challenge, were the insights useful?</p>
<p>Correlation: Most books on behaviour-change help you set goals and guide you in reaching them. But, most New Year’s resolutions aren’t successful. Few books address why you aren’t already doing the things you know you should. % of books, whether they help you set goals and reach them, % goals that are successful, whether they talk about why you aren’t doing what you know you should.</p>
<p>Correlation: People who think they have the most willpower are actually most likely to lose control when tempted. how much willpower you think you have, % of willpower failures.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: The most optimistic challengers fail to predict when, where, and why they will give in. And they expose themselves to more temptations. They’re also more likely to be surprised by setbacks and give up on their goals when they run into difficulty. optimism about your self-control, % of goals for which you predict your failure modes, #temptations you expose yourself to, how surprised you are by setbacks, % giving up when you fail.</p>
<p>Correlation: Everyone struggles in some way with willpower challenges. % of people, struggle with willpower challenge.</p>
<p>Correlation: Whatever the type of willpower challenge, we respond in pretty much the same way. Type of willpower challenge, type of response.</p>

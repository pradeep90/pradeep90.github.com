<p><strong>Questions</strong>: What truths do I want to learn? How exactly can scientific thinking help me there? How do I practice the scientific thinking skills?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="what-do-i-want-to-know">What do I want to know?</h1>
<p>Rather, where am I not getting it right? Where am I failing?</p>
<p>Remember, not every change is an improvement, but every improvement is a change. So, wherever I’m dissatisfied with my performance, I need to find out what will work better. If I’m not getting results despite doing what I thought would work, it means my beliefs are wrong.</p>
<p>Let’s be concrete. I want to learn and apply techniques well so that I perform better. I want to maintain good mental and emotional health. I want to figure out what needs to be done and how to do it. I want to write better essays. I want to write better programs.</p>
<p>Why do I think the scientific method, of all things, will help me?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Step one is to become a scientist. … I shall achieve my objectives through the power… of Science!</p>
<p>… Science is how you go about understanding and controlling the universe&quot;</p>
<p>– Harry Potter, HPMOR Chapter 20</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How does science help you understand and control the universe? It helps you get an accurate causal model of the domain (learning techniques, writing essays, etc). Once you have a good model, you can easily figure out what to do to get what you want.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-practice-the-scientific-method-v1.0">How to Practice the Scientific Method? v1.0</h1>
<p>Your mission is to collect ten causal models. Don’t worry about evidence or alternative hypotheses. Just get their fully-specified causal model. See how they describe the state-transition function. Deliver the models in an essay.</p>
<p>If he makes a prediction, ask why. To start with, see the lead of the paragraph and ask why. That’s all. Example: To be fair, the universities have their hand forced here. Cool. Now, why do they have their hand forced here?</p>
<p>In short, you’ll get around one cause from each paragraph. Do that first. Next, see how you can put those causes together into one model.</p>
<p>Release your essay frequently. Build a rough version first, and then iterate.</p>
<p>August 25, 2015: I’ll do the above on five PG essays both today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>August 27, 2015: I extracted important points from the first five essays. I came up with a causal model for The Island Test. I took the whole day on Before the Startup and was still refining my causal model. I admit I lost sight of my goals; I started thinking about the essay itself instead of just looking for the causal model. I got to half a causal model on Why There Aren’t More Googles.</p>
<h1 id="future-practice-ideas">Future practice ideas</h1>
<p>Break the scientific method into chunks.</p>
<p>Enumerate the different possible states of the domain you’re interested in.</p>
<p>Practice <em>noticing</em> hypotheses aka causal models, experiments, outcomes, predictions, etc.</p>
<p>Remember that a causal model is a state-transition function. Focus on the states and how they change into one another. Don’t simply deal with meaningful-sounding words. When you ask “why”, don’t answer with a cause. See the prediction made aka the final state B. Now, posit a previous state A and a causal model that narrowly transforms A into B (and transforms the initial state into A).</p>
<p>Focus on one particular thing at a time - in one pass, look for hypotheses; in the next, look for experiments; and so on.</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<h2 id="older-ideas">Older Ideas</h2>
<p>Major attitude: everything has an explanation! Explain literally everything! Or, rather, anticipation-constrain literally everything! Figure out the cause behind everything. And, of course, when somebody claims that X is the cause, don’t accept it without evidence.</p>
<p>Don’t accept <em>anything</em> without evidence Somebody: “X is true” You: “So you say. Show me the evidence.”</p>
<p>A plan is based on a hypothesis (or, at least, on certain predictions) Successful plans are those that are based on correct hypotheses A plan is only as good as the hypothesis it is based on! Wait. Does this mean that a hypothesis drives a plan? Like, you could derive a plan from a hypothesis? And that, given one hypothesis, you can only have one possible (deterministic) plan? This would mean that choosing between plans is basically about choosing between hypotheses. i.e., Decision-making boils down to Truth-finding. But it always has! Remember, your Prediction Score determines <em>everything</em>! Corollary: Don’t ask which plan you should choose (among several), but rather, which hypothesis is true out of several. Ask not which plan would be most successful (out of several plans that achieve the same ends) Instead, ask what are the differing predictions between the hypotheses that those plans represent and see what the reality has been so far. Corollary: Don’t ask about the plan. Ask about the <em>hypothesis</em> it relies on. What are the assumptions it is based on? What does it expect will happen? Corollary: This implies you don’t just talk about <em>a</em> plan. You talk about multiple plans and choose between them. Remember, it’s meaningless to talk about just one hypothesis. Plans are programs. Hypotheses are programs.</p>
<p>Historical Perspective: Curiosity about how things came to be the way they are Why do we have supermarkets instead of ration shops? Why voting / democracy? Why civil service? Why parliament? These aren’t arbitrary facts. They are tightly governed by the true hypothesis about reality. They are superbly entangled. You shouldn’t be accepting it either way without question. “X happened? Oh, ok”. “X didn’t happen? Oh, ok.” – Wrong! Why does USA have Hollywood and why is it so popular around the world? It doesn’t have more people than Europe (I think)</p>
<p>Remember: Going into a new field (like Category Theory) is like going into the magical world. New rules to figure out and stuff. But the most important thing is that you’ve still got the experimental method, and that’s what matters.</p>
<p>At least one experiment everyday The Great Experiment Experiment</p>
<p>Maybe take on a project The difficulty I’m having could be because I’m looking for small one-off projects. Maybe the meat is in projects.</p>

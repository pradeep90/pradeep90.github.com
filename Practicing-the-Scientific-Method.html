<p><strong>Questions</strong>: What truths do I want to learn? How exactly can scientific thinking help me there? How do I practice the scientific thinking skills?</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="sole-pursuit-master-the-scientific-method">Sole pursuit: Master the Scientific Method</h1>
<p>I want to announce my goal so that I can be held accountable to it. I want the success or failure of my next one month decided solely by my success in learning to think scientifically. Not by my physical fitness or my essays or anything else. Focus on nothing but the scientific method.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-practice-science">How to practice science</h1>
<p>What is my <a href>product</a> here? What are the changes that the product must reflect over time?</p>
<p>My aim is to master the scientific method. Therefore, the product is my scientific thinking skills.</p>
<p>And how do I change the product, i.e., increase my scientific thinking skills? By Deliberate Practice.</p>
<p>Finally, how do we begin any project? By creating a ridiculously inefficient version one.</p>
<h1 id="science-practice-design-v1.0">Science Practice Design v1.0</h1>
<p>Let’s go with my idea that science is about getting evidence and making your causal model more and more precise and accurate. Also, assume that we won’t run any experiments right now. We’ll just use evidence given by some resource.</p>
<p>First, collect the evidence and predictions given by some resource. Then, round up their causal models by asking “why” for all the predictions. Finally, eliminate or refine the models so that you get a final hypothesis that predicts all the evidence.</p>
<p>Let’s do just that.</p>
<p>Result: I did that with PG’s See Randomness essay. I got to an interesting conclusion.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Right now, I have a pretty decent idea of how to get informal hypotheses from some resource. I need to divide everything into hypotheses, predictions, experiments, and outcomes. I need to look at all the evidence and predictions they provide, ask why for everything, and then refine my model till it covers all the evidence. In some cases, I need to look for differing predictions between alternative hypotheses. This seems to work reasonably well. And I do get some sharp hypotheses at the end.</p>
<p>The only problem is that I don’t know exactly how I’m doing it or whether I’m really doing it right. It feels like magic for now. Basically, I don’t get feedback about how good my hypothesis is. Understanding how causal models really work, in terms of states and the state-transition function, will probably demystify this process for me. Because, then I would be able to test my final model stringently, with no uncertainty as to the outcome.</p>
<p>However, figuring out states and causal models is problem-solving - it’s uncertain. I will probably take a while to do it. My morale will probably flag by then. Instead, I should continue working with my mysterious and vague scientific thinking process above and practicing it on a number of resources. On the side, helped by all the concrete hypotheses I would have collected, I can figure out how causal models really work.</p>
<h1 id="science-practice-design-v2.0">Science Practice Design v2.0</h1>
<p>Mission: Just identify 30 items - hypotheses, predictions, experiments, or outcomes.</p>
<p>Feedback: Number of individual pieces you have collected.</p>
<p>Time: You have one hour.</p>
<p>Remember, everything is either a hypothesis, prediction, experiment, or outcome. Keep in mind that predictions, experiments, and outcomes are just about the value of some particular <em>variable</em>.</p>
<p>We’ll worry about states, state-transition, and alternative hypotheses later. Just do this for now.</p>
<p>Result: I got around 36 items.</p>
<h1 id="science-practice-design-v3.0-tentative">Science Practice Design v3.0 (tentative)</h1>
<p>Continue with the earlier process of classifying everything as hypotheses, etc. and building a causal model from all the evidence.</p>
<p>Mission: Do this on two PG essays and two book chapters.</p>
<h1 id="future-practice-ideas">Future practice ideas</h1>
<p>Think only in terms of hypotheses. Every single thing in the world is either a hypothesis, experiment, prediction, or evidence. That’s all. Focus on one particular thing at a time - in one pass, look for hypotheses; in the next, look for experiments; and so on.</p>
<p>Taboo the major words.</p>
<p>Come up with sanity checks for your hypotheses, evidence, predictions, etc. Example: is this a hypothesis or just a prediction? In short, look at the hypothesis that says “I have a hypothesis here” and see whether it stands up to your experiments. Also, what would falsify this hypothesis? What does this predict will <em>not</em> happen?</p>
<p>We get in trouble, I think, when we try to create hypotheses without looking at some concrete evidence. Why? Because it’s easy to just add words that seem like they explain everything but really don’t. Remember, your causal model is only as good as the evidence you have. It’s only the evidence that will make your model precise and let you predict the outcome of different states. In any case, if some part of a hypothesis doesn’t deal with any evidence, then it has no business being there. This is test-driven development, in other words. Get the evidence, show that your current model fails to predict it, and then postulate some extra cause. So, the key is in finding experiments where your current model doesn’t predict correctly.</p>
<p>Remember that a causal model is a state-transition function. Focus on the states and how they change into one another. Don’t simply deal with meaningful-sounding words. When you ask “why”, don’t answer with a cause. See the prediction made aka the final state B. Now, posit a previous state A and a causal model that narrowly transforms A into B (and transforms the initial state into A).</p>
<p>Right now, “state-transition function” is just a buzzword. I don’t know what exactly the states are and how you’re supposed to describe the transition. So, I need to look at some concrete causal models and see how they do it. I suspect they will describe the states using certain variables.</p>
<p>Always remember: science is all about getting highly predictive causal models.</p>
<p>Give me three concrete domains in which to “practice science” aka build causal models.</p>
<p>Where do you plan to use the scientific method in the future? What chunks will you be using? Practice those chunks.</p>
<p>How do I get feedback on my practice? Some measurement - maybe number of reps - number of reps of what?</p>
<p>Have Fun Failure. You should fail about 80% of the time.</p>
<p>Practice noticing confusion and noticing surprise. Also, learn to notice naive realism.</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<h2 id="older-ideas">Older Ideas</h2>
<p>Major attitude: everything has an explanation! Explain literally everything! Or, rather, anticipation-constrain literally everything! Figure out the cause behind everything. And, of course, when somebody claims that X is the cause, don’t accept it without evidence.</p>
<p>Don’t accept <em>anything</em> without evidence Somebody: “X is true” You: “So you say. Show me the evidence.”</p>
<p>A plan is based on a hypothesis (or, at least, on certain predictions) Successful plans are those that are based on correct hypotheses A plan is only as good as the hypothesis it is based on! Wait. Does this mean that a hypothesis drives a plan? Like, you could derive a plan from a hypothesis? And that, given one hypothesis, you can only have one possible (deterministic) plan? This would mean that choosing between plans is basically about choosing between hypotheses. i.e., Decision-making boils down to Truth-finding. But it always has! Remember, your Prediction Score determines <em>everything</em>! Corollary: Don’t ask which plan you should choose (among several), but rather, which hypothesis is true out of several. Ask not which plan would be most successful (out of several plans that achieve the same ends) Instead, ask what are the differing predictions between the hypotheses that those plans represent and see what the reality has been so far. Corollary: Don’t ask about the plan. Ask about the <em>hypothesis</em> it relies on. What are the assumptions it is based on? What does it expect will happen? Corollary: This implies you don’t just talk about <em>a</em> plan. You talk about multiple plans and choose between them. Remember, it’s meaningless to talk about just one hypothesis. Plans are programs. Hypotheses are programs.</p>
<p>Historical Perspective: Curiosity about how things came to be the way they are Why do we have supermarkets instead of ration shops? Why voting / democracy? Why civil service? Why parliament? These aren’t arbitrary facts. They are tightly governed by the true hypothesis about reality. They are superbly entangled. You shouldn’t be accepting it either way without question. “X happened? Oh, ok”. “X didn’t happen? Oh, ok.” – Wrong! Why does USA have Hollywood and why is it so popular around the world? It doesn’t have more people than Europe (I think)</p>
<p>Remember: Going into a new field (like Category Theory) is like going into the magical world. New rules to figure out and stuff. But the most important thing is that you’ve still got the experimental method, and that’s what matters.</p>
<p>At least one experiment everyday The Great Experiment Experiment</p>
<p>Maybe take on a project The difficulty I’m having could be because I’m looking for small one-off projects. Maybe the meat is in projects.</p>

<p>Your mission is to collect ten causal models. Don’t worry about evidence or alternative hypotheses. Just get their fully-specified causal model. See how they describe the state-transition function. Deliver the models in an essay.</p>
<p>If he makes a prediction, ask why. To start with, see the lead of the paragraph and ask why. That’s all. Example: To be fair, the universities have their hand forced here. Cool. Now, why do they have their hand forced here?</p>
<p>In short, you’ll get around one cause from each paragraph. Do that first. Next, see how you can put those causes together into one model.</p>
<p>Release your essay frequently. Build a rough version first, and then iterate.</p>
<p>August 25, 2015: I’ll do the above on five PG essays both today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>August 27, 2015: I extracted important points from the first five essays. I came up with a causal model for The Island Test. I took the whole day on Before the Startup and was still refining my causal model. I admit I lost sight of my goals; I started thinking about the essay itself instead of just looking for the causal model. I got to half a causal model on Why There Aren’t More Googles.</p>
<p>Result: Didn’t succeed in collecting any causal models. No problem.</p>
<h3 id="practicing-the-scientific-method-v2.0">Practicing the Scientific Method v2.0</h3>
<p>Let’s practice thinking only in terms of hypotheses and evidence.</p>
<p>You have 15 minutes. Gather 2 hypotheses and 5 pieces of evidence.</p>
<p>Go!</p>
<p>Result: Did it. It took me 15 minutes to get predictions from the first chapter of The Pragmatic Programmer. Then, it took me half an hour and four summaries to build a concise hypothesis from the predictions.</p>
<h3 id="practicing-the-scientific-method-v3.0">Practicing the Scientific Method v3.0</h3>
<p>You have 10 minutes. Get the evidence and a rough hypothesis from PG’s “After the Ladder”.</p>
<p>Result: It took me 25 minutes. But, I got a decent summary.</p>

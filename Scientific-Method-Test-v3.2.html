<h1 id="scientific-method-v3.2">Scientific Method v3.2</h1>
<p>Resource: The Will Power Instinct, by Kelly McGonigal</p>
<p>Mission: Summarize the Introduction chapter of the book.</p>
<p>Let’s use my v3.0 algorithm: Identify key variables, get some evidence, generate alternative models.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-two-the-willpower-instinct">Chapter Two: The Willpower Instinct</h1>
<p>Which self dominates in willpower challenges depends on whether we are under chronic stress.</p>
<p>Key variables: which self dominates in willpower challenges; stress level</p>
<h1 id="evidence">Evidence</h1>
<p>When amygdala thinks there’s a threat, it prompts the flight-or-fight response, releasing stress hormones, more energy, oxygen, etc.</p>
<p>It makes you more impulsive (So, impulsive action is caused by your stress level?). It redirects your physical and mental energy towards averting the threat.</p>
<p>At the promise of reward, your brain releases the neurotransmitter dopamine to the areas that control attention, motivation, and action.</p>
<p>The threat is not the external object providing the promise of reward, it’s your own desire.</p>
<p>Pause-and-plan response: perception of an internal conflict (An I will challenge or an I won’t challenge);</p>
<p>You have a self-monitoring system in the brain that alerts your self-control system when you have thoughts, emotions, or sensations that you’re going to do something you will regret.</p>
<p>The pause-and-plan response keeps you from immediately following your impulses.</p>
<p>When people are under stress, heart rate goes up, variability goes down.</p>
<p>When you successfully exert self-control, you calm stress, and therefore reduce impulsive action, and your heart rate goes down, variability goes up.</p>
<p>Risk of relapse for recovering alcoholics depends on whether their heart rate variability goes up or down when they see a drink.</p>
<p>How good you are at ignoring distractions, delaying gratification, and dealing with stressful situations depends on your heart rate variability. So, they say how much willpower depends on how high your heart rate variability is.</p>
<p>Heart rate variability is affected by what you eat and the air quality.</p>
<p>Heart rate variability is affected by anything that puts a stress on your mind and body. Anxiety, anger, depression, and loneliness are correlated with lower heart rate variability. Ditto for chronic pain and illness.</p>
<p>Meditation trains your brain and also increases your heart rate variability. Anything that reduces stress also increases your heart rate variability - like exercise, good sleep, good food, quality time with friends and family.</p>
<p>Two months of treatment, improvement in attention spans and ability to ignore distractions; reduced smoking, drinking, and caffeine intake.</p>
<p>Cravings are reduced by 15 minutes on a treadmill. Long-term exercise relieves everyday stress and is as powerful an antidepressant as Prozac (I hope this was an intervention). Working out also increases baseline heart rate variability and trains the brain, especially in the PFC.</p>
<p>Being mildly but chronically sleep deprived makes you more susceptible to stress, cravings, and temptation.</p>
<p>“If you are chronically sleep deprived, you may find yourself feeling regret at the end of the day, wondering why you gave in again to temptation or put off doing what you needed to do. It’s easy to let this spiral into shame and guilt.”</p>
<p>When you’re tired, your cells (in your body and brain) have trouble absorbing glucose from the bloodstream, which leaves them with less energy and makes you feel exhausted. This state makes you crave sweets and caffeine.</p>
<p>So, when you’re tired, you will have mild prefrontal dysfunction.</p>
<p>When your pfc is impaired, it doesn’t quiet the alarm system to manage stress and cravings. So, how much the alarm system reacts to everyday stress depends on how functional your pfc is.</p>
<p>Intervention: five minutes of breath-focus meditation a day helped recovering addicts fall asleep and gain an hour of quality sleep, which reduced the risk of drug relapse.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: chronic willpower demands high levels of energy, which can divert resources from the immune system and thus increase your chances of getting sick.</p>
<p>Relaxing increases heart rate variability by activating the parasympathetic nervous system and quieting the sympathetic nervous system. It also enhances your immune function and lowers stress hormones.</p>
<p>Willpower is not a personality trait or a virtue.</p>
<p>Fight-or-flight response floods the body with energy to act impulsively, and takes energy away from the deliberative part of your brain. The pause-and-plan response does the opposite.</p>
<p>75% of Americans experience high levels of stress.</p>
<p>Two hours less sleep per night than the average in 1960.</p>
<h1 id="questions-we-should-be-asking">Questions we should be asking</h1>
<p>How does stress affect willpower? Does anything else come in between?</p>
<p>What affects your stress level?</p>

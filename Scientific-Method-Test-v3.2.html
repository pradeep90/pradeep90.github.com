<h1 id="scientific-method-v3.2">Scientific Method v3.2</h1>
<p>Resource: The Will Power Instinct, by Kelly McGonigal</p>
<p>Mission: Summarize the Introduction chapter of the book.</p>
<p>Let’s use my v3.0 algorithm: Identify key variables, get some evidence, generate alternative models.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-two-the-willpower-instinct">Chapter Two: The Willpower Instinct</h1>
<p>Which self dominates in willpower challenges depends on whether we are under chronic stress.</p>
<p>Key variables: which self dominates in willpower challenges; stress level</p>
<h1 id="evidence">Evidence</h1>
<p>When amygdala thinks there’s an external threat, it prompts the fight-or-flight response, releasing stress hormones, more energy, oxygen, etc. Stress hormones, energy level, oxygen, etc. depend on whether the amygdala is aroused, which depends on whether it perceives an external threat.</p>
<p>Your focus of attention depends on whether the fight-or-flight response is active.</p>
<p>Whether your PFC is inhibited or not depends on the fight-or-flight response. And impulse control depends on the PFC being active.</p>
<p>At the promise of reward, your brain releases the neurotransmitter dopamine to the areas that control attention, motivation, and action. promise of reward -&gt; dopamine -&gt; attention, motivation, action. So, where you pay attention, what you do, etc. depend on dopamine levels, which depends on the promise of reward.</p>
<p>Pause-and-plan response depends on your perception of an internal conflict (An I will challenge or an I won’t challenge); (What if you’re distracted?)</p>
<p>What else causes the pause-and-plan response?</p>
<p>You have a self-monitoring system in the brain that alerts your self-control system when you have thoughts, emotions, or sensations that you’re going to do something you will regret.</p>
<p>The pause-and-plan response redirects energy from the body to the brain. Energy to the brain vs body depends on pause-and-plan response.</p>
<p>The pause-and-plan response keeps you from immediately following your impulses. Whether you immediately follow your impulses depends on the pause-and-plan response.</p>
<p>When people are under stress, heart rate goes up, variability goes down. Heart rate depends on stress. heart rate variability depends on stress.</p>
<p>When you successfully exert self-control, you calm stress, and reduce impulsive action; your heart rate goes down, variability goes up. heart rate and heart rate variability also seem to depend on whether you exert self-control. However, is that because self-control calms stress or directly because of self-control?</p>
<p>Risk of relapse for recovering alcoholics is correlated with whether their heart rate variability goes up or down when they see a drink. Either heart rate variability could be the cause of successful self-control or self-control could be causing heart rate variability or something else could be causing both.</p>
<p>How good you are at ignoring distractions, delaying gratification, and dealing with stressful situations depends on your heart rate variability. So, they say how much willpower depends on how high your heart rate variability is. Here, heart rate variability came before the self-control event. So, either heart rate variability is causing higher self-control, or something else is causing both.</p>
<p>Heart rate variability is affected by what you eat and the air quality.</p>
<p>Heart rate variability is affected by anything that puts a stress on your mind and body. Anxiety, anger, depression, and loneliness are correlated with lower heart rate variability. Ditto for chronic pain and illness. These could cause stress which causes heart rate variability, or something could cause both.</p>
<p>Meditation trains your brain and also increases your heart rate variability. Heart rate variability depends on meditation. Could it be because meditation reduces stress?</p>
<p>Anything that reduces stress also increases your heart rate variability - like exercise, good sleep, good food, quality time with friends and family. stress depends on these things.</p>
<p>Two months of exercise, improvement in attention spans and ability to ignore distractions; reduced smoking, drinking, and caffeine intake. smoking, etc. depend on willpower (I won’t, specifically); willpower depends on exercise (how exactly? which kinds of exercise?). willpower depends on those parts of the brain (and on heart rate variability?) and also on stress. exercise relieves stress and improves those parts of the brain.</p>
<p>Cravings are reduced by 15 minutes on a treadmill. Long-term exercise relieves everyday stress and is as powerful an antidepressant as Prozac (I hope this was an intervention). Working out also increases baseline heart rate variability and trains the brain, especially in the PFC.</p>
<p>Being mildly but chronically sleep deprived makes you more susceptible to stress, cravings, and temptation.</p>
<p>“If you are chronically sleep deprived, you may find yourself feeling regret at the end of the day, wondering why you gave in again to temptation or put off doing what you needed to do. It’s easy to let this spiral into shame and guilt.”</p>
<p>When you’re tired, your cells (in your body and brain) have trouble absorbing glucose from the bloodstream, which leaves them with less energy and makes you feel exhausted. This state makes you crave sweets and caffeine.</p>
<p>willpower depends on the energy available to the brain, which depends on how tired you are, which depends on how much sleep you’ve got.</p>
<p>So, when you’re tired, you will have mild prefrontal dysfunction.</p>
<p>When your pfc is impaired, it doesn’t quiet the alarm system to manage stress and cravings. So, how much the alarm system reacts to everyday stress depends on how functional your pfc is.</p>
<p>Intervention: five minutes of breath-focus meditation a day helped recovering addicts fall asleep and gain an hour of quality sleep, which reduced the risk of drug relapse. Amount of sleep depends on meditation (but how? and why did just five minutes make such a big difference?).</p>
<p>Hypothesis: chronic willpower demands high levels of energy, which can divert resources from the immune system and thus increase your chances of getting sick.</p>
<p>Relaxing increases heart rate variability by activating the parasympathetic nervous system and quieting the sympathetic nervous system. It also enhances your immune function and lowers stress hormones. Stress hormones depend on relaxation. So does heart rate variability (so what?).</p>
<p>Willpower is not a personality trait or a virtue. Willpower is not directly caused by virtue or personality.</p>
<p>Fight-or-flight response floods the body with energy to act impulsively, and takes energy away from the deliberative part of your brain. The pause-and-plan response does the opposite.</p>
<p>75% of Americans experience high levels of stress. That’s a correlation. Being American could cause stress, or having stress could cause you to be American (nonsense), or something else could cause both. But, whether you’re American is decided by your place of birth and other things. Those things couldn’t have directly caused stress. So, the fact that you’re American should have caused stress.</p>
<p>Two hours less sleep per night than the average in 1960. Again, a correlation.</p>
<h1 id="questions-we-should-be-asking">Questions we should be asking</h1>
<p>How does stress affect willpower? Does anything else come in between?</p>
<p>What affects your stress level?</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>fight-or-flight response depends on external threat. Also, whether it reacts to everyday stress depends on how functional your PFC is. Also, on how much relaxation you’ve got.</p>
<p>Stress level depends on the fight-or-flight response. I think it also depends on anxiety, anger, depression, etc. Also, on meditation. Other stuff like exercise, good sleep, good food, quality time with friends and family.</p>
<p>Your focus of attention depends on the fight-or-flight response. It also depends on dopamine levels, which depends on the promise of reward.</p>
<p>Whether your PFC is inhibited depends on the fight-or-flight response; it also depends on whether your self-monitoring system alerts it (which depends on whether you have thoughts, etc. that you’re going to do something regrettable)</p>
<p>Energy available to the brain depends on fight-or-flight response and pause-and-plan response. Also, on how tired you are.</p>
<p>How tired you are depends on how much sleep you’ve got.</p>
<p>Amount of sleep depends on how much breath-focus meditation you did. How, though?</p>
<p>Impulse control depends on the PFC being active.</p>
<p>TODO: pause-and-plan response depends on your perception of an internal threat.</p>
<p>TODO: How do you know whether the fight-or-flight response is going on? What makes it stop? Similarly, how do you know whether the pause-and-plan response is going on? What makes that stop?</p>
<p>The reason I’m so confused about the pause-and-plan response is because it’s too vague and far-reaching. It doesn’t say exactly what leads to what, on a local basis. It just says that there’s a blank, global force called “the pause-and-plan response” that magically makes things happen.</p>
<p>heart rate variability depends on stress and also on self-control (not sure whether this is because self-control decreases stress or because it directly affects heart rate variability). Wikipedia says heart rate variability depends on the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. fight-or-flight response depends on the sympathetic nervous system. rest-and-digest or “feed and breed” depend on the parasympathetic nervous system. So, it does not directly depend on the PFC in any way. So, if self-control decreases heart rate variability, it must be because it reduces stress. Also, heart rate variability depends on what you eat and the quality of the air you breath - I guess these affect the nervous system somehow.</p>
<p>self-control systems of your brain depend on exercise.</p>

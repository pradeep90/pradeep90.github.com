<h1 id="quotes-from-ericssons-book-peak">Quotes from Ericsson’s book “Peak”</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>In his book, Epstein dramatized Thomas’s accomplishments by comparing him with Stefan Holm of Sweden, who had been training rigorously on the high jump ever since he was a kid and had logged more than twenty thousand hours of practice. Yet at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics he was beaten by Thomas, who, Epstein estimated, had only a few hundred hours of training.</p>
<p>There is clearly a fascination with this type of story, where someone seems to have come out of nowhere to excel as some sort of naturally gifted performer. And these days, because “the ten-thousand-hour rule” has become so well known, the stories are often written as “proof” that this rule is wrong. Donald Thomas or someone else shows us that it is indeed possible to become the best in the world without practicing that much, if only you are born with the right genes.</p>
<p>I get it. People want to believe that there is <strong>magic</strong> in life, that not everything has to abide by the staid, boring rules of the real world. And what could be more magical than being born with some <strong>incredible ability that doesn’t require hard work or discipline to develop</strong>? There is an entire comic-book industry built on that premise - that sometimes something magical happens, and you <strong>suddenly</strong> acquire incredible powers. Unbeknownst to you, you were actually born on the planet Krypton and you can fly. Or you were bitten by a radioactive spider and you can cling to walls. Or you were exposed to cosmic radiation and now you can become invisible.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h1>
<p>Skill, aka the ability of pattern recognition and response (as opposed to deliberate reasoning), is completely mundane. Study better and you will get better results. There’s no magic to it.</p>
<p>This means there is something to Richard Hamming’s idea of compound returns for those who consistently study more over decades. Have faith.</p>
<p>Corollary: Anybody can reach high skill in a field if they do enough deliberate practice.</p>
<h1 id="mentors">Mentors</h1>
<p>I think you first try to become identical to your mentor, then branch out as you gain more experience, and finally discover your own “voice”.</p>
<p>This is why people familiar with the mentor often call the mentee as a “mini-version” of the person. For example, in Suits, people routinely tell Mike Ross that he sounds “just like Harvey [Specter]” or call him “baby Harvey”.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to analyze each feature of your mentor to decide whether to assimilate it, you just imitate all of them blindly. Later, when you’re able to get results as well as him, you start tweaking things to find what works better.</p>
<h1 id="whiplash---observations">Whiplash - Observations</h1>
<p>Note: This is a fictional movie, so everything below is <em>fictional evidence</em>. Be careful what you infer from it. I think it’s best used as a mnemonic for the empirically-tested principles of deliberate practice - evidence come to life.</p>
<p>The following are notes I made about the movie in chronological order. (This was my fourth or fifth time watching it.)</p>
<h2 id="first-act">First Act</h2>
<p>At first, his eyes were on the lead drummer and his girlfriend. So, he was distracted.</p>
<p>Later, his eyes saw the advanced group. Ignition! That’s when he really began to focus.</p>
<p>Learn to feel it: Andrew listened to Buddy Rich’s Birdland after his practice so that he can compare himself to a master. This is how you get feedback about your practice.</p>
<p>The test: I think Andrew wasn’t completely superior than the other drummer. He had just practiced the double-time swing a lot. Why did Fletcher select him, then? I think he saw Andrew’s hunger, his drive to become better. Given that the other drummer had other aims in life (as evidenced by the sunglasses hanging from his t-shirt), a single-minded guy like Andrew would eventually overtake him.</p>
<p>Still has distractions: he asked that girl out even though he needed to focus fully on doing well in the advanced group. He’s getting happiness from other sources.</p>
<p>He feels like an insect on the floor compared to these advanced guys.</p>
<p>Those guys have scrawled notes like “LIL LOUDER” and “SOFTER” on their music sheets. Shows they’ve thought about each part and got feedback about their current skills.</p>
<p>Talk about a meritocracy! Those guys respect <em>only</em> competence. Nothing else matters. I’m glad that such places exist. (I suspect that happens in any advanced group.)</p>
<p>Fletcher is rude to everybody.</p>
<p>Fine distinctions: Fletcher can tell when you’re “dragging” or “rushing” even a little bit. Andrew can’t yet.</p>
<p><strong>Observation</strong>: Fletcher humiliated Andrew for not being able to tell whether he was rushing or dragging. He also attacked all of Andrew’s weak points (like not having a mother, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: Fletcher was trying to induce the following rule in Andrew’s mind: if you can’t play music well, you’re a loser.</p>
<p>How? By removing any shred of self-respect Andrew may have had, and then letting him feel good <em>only</em> when he played well. Thus, if Andrew wanted to feel good about himself (and I think we all do), his only option would be to become a great music player. Win-win. Kinda.</p>
<p>In short, anytime Andrew did anything other than “play music well”, Fletcher would berate and humiliate him. If Andrew played well, Fletcher would spare him. So, Andrew’s only choice was to learn to play well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Start practicing harder, Niemann.</p>
<p>– Fletcher, Whiplash.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: If this is the way you want to become skilled, you can’t have any other source of self-respect.</p>
<p>That would defeat the above strategy by giving Andrew an out. So, he can’t have a girlfriend (according to the philosophy of the film).</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: If you accept the above philosophy, the way to become great is to make your work your only source of self-respect and deny yourself any other kind.</p>
<p><strong>Test</strong>: If you don’t have a single source of self-respect, if you can tolerate sucking at your chosen field, then you aren’t on the track to greatness. Either your skill has grown in the last week or you feel miserable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Eric Foreman: Why are you doing this to me? I was happy.</p>
<p>Dr. Gregory House: You were aspiring to be content.</p>
<p>Dr. Eric Foreman: Don’t give me a semantic argument. I was content with the way things were. That’s what happiness means.</p>
<p>Dr. Gregory House: Right. If we were all satisfied with what we had, what a beautiful world it would be. We’d all slowly starve to death in our own filth but at least we’d be happy. <strong>Listen, I need your self worth to hang on this job. For kicking ass to be all that lets you rise above miserable.</strong> If waking up in the morning is enough, I don’t need you.</p>
<p>– House MD, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0777001/quotes?item=qt0470961">Forever</a> (slightly edited; emphasis mine)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: You <em>should</em> feel humiliated if you don’t know some concept. It will drive you to master concepts better.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with others for making fun of you for it or with you for feeling bad about it. If you suck at your chosen field, that is cause for concern. For example, if you don’t know how to identify the “first act” of a story, and you consider yourself well-read, you suck.</p>
<h2 id="second-act">Second Act</h2>
<p>People around the conservatory are always talking about music or lugging around their huge instruments (giggity).</p>
<p>He keeps staring at posters of his role model Buddy Rich and also listening to his albums over and over.</p>
<p>He could drain away his pain by accepting his father’s sympathy. Or… he could practice as if he was possessed. He chose the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: Don’t accept sympathy for your failures. That shoots a hole in the above strategy just like another source of happiness.</p>
<p>His girlfriend is the poster-child for people getting happiness for free! The complete antithesis of everything Fletcher and Andrew stand for. She refuses to feel bad about herself because she doesn’t have a clear career goal or anything at all. Andrew can’t do that. He couldn’t do that even before meeting Fletcher.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Andrew: What do you do?</p>
<p>Nicole: I go to Fordham.</p>
<p>Andrew: What do you study?</p>
<p>Nicole: I don’t have a major yet.</p>
<p>Andrew: But, like, what do you want to study?</p>
<p>Nicole: I don’t really know. I don’t know yet.</p>
<p>Andrew: So Fordham was just like a random school?</p>
<p>Nicole: No, I applied to a bunch of schools, Fordham let me in. Why’d you pick Shaffer?</p>
<p>Andrew: It’s the best music school in the country.</p>
<p>Nicole: Well, Fordham was Fordham.</p>
<p>– Whiplash</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that Andrew knows exactly what and where he wants to study.</p>
<p>He smiled when he played well (and got promoted to core drummer). He also smiled when he was watching a video of an expert drummer. So, he’s now getting his happiness only from drumming. Not so much from his girlfriend.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it subjective?” “No.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uncle Frank: You got any friends, Andy?</p>
<p>Andrew: No.</p>
<p>Uncle Frank: Oh, why’s that?</p>
<p>Andrew: I don’t know, I just never really saw the use.</p>
<p>Uncle Frank: Well, who are you going to play with otherwise? Lennon and McCartney, they were school buddies, am I right?</p>
<p>Andrew: Charlie Parker didn’t know anybody ’til Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head.</p>
<p>Uncle Frank: So that’s your idea of success, huh?</p>
<p>Andrew: I think being the greatest musician of the 20th century is anybody’s idea of success.</p>
<p>Jim: Dying broke and drunk and full of heroin at the age of 34 is not exactly my idea of success.</p>
<p>Andrew: I’d rather die drunk, broke at 34 and have people at a dinner table talk about me than live to be rich and sober at 90 and nobody remembered who I was.</p>
<p>Uncle Frank: Ah, but your friends will remember you, that’s the point.</p>
<p>Andrew: None of us were friends with Charlie Parker. <em>That’s</em> the point.</p>
<p>Uncle Frank: Travis and Dustin? They have plenty of friends and plenty of purpose.</p>
<p>Andrew: I’m sure they’ll make great school board presidents someday.</p>
<p>Dustin: Oh, that’s what this is all about? You think you’re better than us?</p>
<p>Andrew: You catch on quick. Are you in Model UN?</p>
<p>Travis: I got a reply for you, Andrew. You think Carleton football’s a joke? Come play with us.</p>
<p>Andrew: Four words you will never hear from the NFL.</p>
<p>Aunt Emma: Who wants dessert?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Breaking up with his girlfriend: He can’t pay attention to anything else but drumming. The happiness she gives him is not worth the drumming practice he would miss out on.</p>
<p>Commitment: The band members stick around even till 2am to complete their practice session. There’s nothing more important in their life than their music practice.</p>
<p>He sleeps next to his drum kit. Talk about the top idea in your mind!</p>
<h2 id="third-act">Third Act</h2>
<p>He now gets a bit of happiness from his father. Wow. I think the previous time they showed him watching a movie with his father, it was before he became truly serious about drumming. And they’re showing that again.</p>
<p>He says he was there “to push people beyond what was expected of them”. So, “what was expected” was the bar you needed to clear to feel good. He raised the bar and made people feel miserable unless they cleared it. That is what it means to push people - consider any lesser attempt to be a failure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Terence Fletcher: I don’t think people understood what it was I was doing at Shaffer. I wasn’t there to conduct. Any fucking moron can wave his arms and keep people in tempo. I was there to push people beyond what’s expected of them. I believe that is… an absolute necessity. Otherwise, we’re depriving the world of the next Louis Armstrong. The next Charlie Parker. I told you that story about how Charlie Parker became Charlie Parker, right?</p>
<p>Andrew: Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head.</p>
<p>Terence Fletcher: Exactly. Parker’s a young kid, pretty good on the sax. Gets up to play at a cutting session, and he fucks it up. And Jones nearly decapitates him for it. <strong>And he’s laughed off-stage. Cries himself to sleep that night, but the next morning, what does he do? He practices. And he practices and he practices with one goal in mind, never to be laughed at again.</strong> And a year later, he goes back to the Reno and he steps up on that stage, and plays the best motherfucking solo the world has ever heard. So imagine if Jones had just said, “Well, that’s okay, Charlie. That was all right. Good job.” And then Charlie thinks to himself, “Well, shit, I did do a pretty good job.” End of story. No Bird. That, to me, is an absolute tragedy. But that’s just what the world wants now. People wonder why jazz is dying.</p>
<p>– Whiplash (emphasis mine)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fletcher doesn’t believe it’s <em>dishonourable</em> to practice because you never want to be laughed at again. He seems to believe it’s useful motivation. It works, after all, if the film is right.</p>
<p>I was stuck thinking that only pure motivations are worthy of having - like practicing to become a better player, regardless of whether others appreciate you. Maybe it’s <em>ok</em> to have impure motivations. Maybe wanting to beat others is fine, as long as you meet your goals. Whatever makes you practice is fine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]here are no two words in the English language more harmful than “good job”.</p>
<p>– Fletcher, Whiplash</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Note that Andrew gets a master coach in the form of Fletcher and a role model in the form of Buddy Rich.</p>
<p>Also note that Andrew got continuous feedback on each aspect of his drumming. He found out if he was rushing or dragging, or whether his double-time swing was fast enough.</p>
<p>He also tries to get happiness from Nicole. But she’s moved on.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the climax, his father gives him sympathy, but he refuses to settle for it. The only way he can feel good is by proving himself as a drummer.</p>
<p>A smile that lasts half a second - that’s Andrew’s reward for playing the solo of his life. And for him, it was worth it.</p>
<h1 id="rockstar">Rockstar</h1>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: Valuable information lies behind the price of pain and embarrassment.</p>
<p>He has to get slapped and made fun of before he discovers what works.</p>
<p>I would do well to copy the same. My Tamil hypothesis <em>was</em> unfalsifiable and hard to test. Never make that mistake again, sure, but accept this lesson. Don’t flinch. Seek out more such harsh information, all taught for the entry price of pain.</p>
<h2 id="all-about-risk-taking">All about Risk-Taking?</h2>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: Reinforce risk-taking by revelling in the victories and taking pain as a positive (through fun failure).</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: Do risky things all the time? Seek out things outside your comfort zone? For example, sit on the cliffs of snowy mountains?</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Would an advanced rationalist do risky things all the time? Would he surround himself with things that are “high” - like mountains, etc. - things that have come from great risk?</p>
<p>For example, you could respect a mountain hike more than a simple jog in a park.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: Hmm… Maybe the idea is to <em>respect</em> only those things that have come from risks, so that you reinforce the rule that risk-taking is awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: You would have to <em>disdain</em> things that came from safety and security.</p>
<p>Like a simple N-queens program instead of one that demands full use of your Haskell knowledge. Or a toy program instead of a complex legacy browser engine.</p>
<p>You must respect yourself only when, for example, you watch Rockstar even when you feel like skipping it and just watching some light and safe YouTube videos. Or when you go to the gym even when you fucking don’t want to.</p>
<p>Hackers do this by working only on projects that are challenging. That’s the hacker spirit.</p>
<p>So, it’s basically a sin to work on anything that is less than challenging.</p>
<h2 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h2>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: Ah! The test for working at the edge of your abilities: Are you feeling vulnerable?</p>
<p>If not, you’re playing it safe. Can’t afford that. Life’s too short for that kind of shit.</p>
<p>Note: It would be great if you could reinforce actions that lead to vulnerability instead of punishing them.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: We have the rule: vulnerability implies that we are shameful.</p>
<p>That would explain why we avoid vulnerability. We’ve reinforced the rule that it means we’re unworthy. So, instead, you need to reinforce the rule that vulnerability does not imply you’re unworthy, or better, that it implies you’re <em>worthy</em>. Feel vulnerable and reward yourself for it.</p>
<p>Note that as long as you have the above rule, you will avoid anything that makes you feel vulnerable, and thus run in the opposite direction from problems that make you work at the edge of your ability.</p>
<p>Why respect vulnerable actions?</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: When you keep taking vulnerable actions, you reinforce the belief that vulnerability implies you’re awesome (and extinguish the belief that it implies you’re a loser). It starts to feel normal and necessary.</p>
<p>So, get used to leaning on a tree on a snowy mountain cliff. That’s going to be your life.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: Boredom is evil, as ESR said. That’s the sign of anti-vulnerability. You’re not taking any risks.</p>
<p>Exemplars: the reporter has to become shameless to get details about Jordan; being homeless; learning from the dargah; running off to Prague on a whim; taking in new sights and trying out new things in a new country; dancing; “tera dar, tera pyaar, teri waah… tu hi rakh… rakh saala!” - holding a different identity from others;</p>
<p>Exemplars of non-vulnerability: safe job in the family business, AC, video games; according to him, classical music (“why do you keep playing the same thing over and over and over?”); comfortable shopping in Prague; take you out to lunch at some good restaurant; volunteer on the organizing committee of the music show; the whole family in Prague seems “neat and clean”</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: How to make decisions: choose the option with maximum vulnerability. Essentially, never play it safe (unless it’s a critical matter).</p>
<p>For example, if one choice is to go to a known vacation spot and another is to go to an unfamiliar but cool-sounding place, pick the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: Don’t go to the same restaurant twice (until you’ve been to all the others in your vicinity).</p>
<h2 id="variables-and-feedback">Variables and feedback</h2>
<p>Stage presence; attitude And he fucking tested it right there and got feedback.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: Isse oonchi udaan naa teri; tere andar woh nahi hain just hard work won’t do need the dil and personality of an artist for that, need the life of pain - pain, dukh, dard, aansu</p>
<p>Ignition: better get busy lots of hurt and difficulties Looks at ALL the variables that can cause pain orphan, poverty, etc.</p>
<p>Goes for the only intervention left to him: broken heart</p>
<p>And what better way to get maximum pain than from a heart-breaking <em>machine</em>?</p>
<p>And the humiliation of rejection and the loss of reputn doesn’t matter because all he cares about is music.</p>
<p>New name: Jordan!</p>

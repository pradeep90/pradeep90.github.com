<h1 id="quotes-from-ericssons-book-peak">Quotes from Ericsson’s book “Peak”</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>In his book, Epstein dramatized Thomas’s accomplishments by comparing him with Stefan Holm of Sweden, who had been training rigorously on the high jump ever since he was a kid and had logged more than twenty thousand hours of practice. Yet at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics he was beaten by Thomas, who, Epstein estimated, had only a few hundred hours of training.</p>
<p>There is clearly a fascination with this type of story, where someone seems to have come out of nowhere to excel as some sort of naturally gifted performer. And these days, because “the ten-thousand-hour rule” has become so well known, the stories are often written as “proof” that this rule is wrong. Donald Thomas or someone else shows us that it is indeed possible to become the best in the world without practicing that much, if only you are born with the right genes.</p>
<p>I get it. People want to believe that there is <strong>magic</strong> in life, that not everything has to abide by the staid, boring rules of the real world. And what could be more magical than being born with some <strong>incredible ability that doesn’t require hard work or discipline to develop</strong>? There is an entire comic-book industry built on that premise - that sometimes something magical happens, and you <strong>suddenly</strong> acquire incredible powers. Unbeknownst to you, you were actually born on the planet Krypton and you can fly. Or you were bitten by a radioactive spider and you can cling to walls. Or you were exposed to cosmic radiation and now you can become invisible.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h1>
<p>Skill, aka the ability of pattern recognition and response (as opposed to deliberate reasoning), is completely mundane. Study better and you will get better results. There’s no magic to it.</p>
<p>This means there is something to Richard Hamming’s idea of compound returns for those who consistently study more over decades. Have faith.</p>
<p>Corollary: Anybody can reach high skill in a field if they do enough deliberate practice.</p>

<p>What will I be like in 5 years from now (at the end of 2020)?</p>
<p>What will I be like in 15 years from now (at the end of 2030)?</p>
<p>How powerful do I want myself to be? And what do I need to do now to make sure that vision of the future comes true? What am I doing now that I will regret most? What do I need to do more of? What sort of new skills do I need to master? What are some people who already possess the kinds of skills I want in the future? How did they do it?</p>
<p>Remember, you become good only at what you practice. You only have so much time. Use it well.</p>
<h1 id="will-power">Will Power</h1>
<p>Kelly McGonigal recommends writing a letter to your current self from your future self. We need to make ourselves realize that we are the ones who will have those future experiences, so that we take responsibility for the consequences of our current actions.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Also, visualize yourself failing! How could it all go wrong? What will the obstacles be? Basically, build a good model of your path ahead so that you can predict your future failures. You shouldn’t be shocked by setbacks; you should have seen them coming. Keep updating your model everyday based on the evidence. For example, did you put off going to the gym because you didn’t have your gym clothes with you? Well, next time, make sure you do.</p>
<h1 id="caution">Caution</h1>
<p>Note that your feeling of resolve about how you’re definitely going to make it is not evidence either way. Whether you’re in a world where you do eventually go on to make it or in a world where you fall hopelessly short, you still have those feeling. Look at all the failed wannabes in entertainment, sports, business, and other domains. They all probably had the feeling that they were going to make it, hence their surprise and disillusionment.</p>
<p>A corollary is that you need to seek evidence from outside. Mere feeling of resolve is not enough. See whether you have the necessary skills and actual resolve, as shown by your track record.</p>

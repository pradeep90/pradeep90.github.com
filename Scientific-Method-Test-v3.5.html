<h1 id="scientific-method-v3.5">Scientific Method v3.5</h1>
<p>Here’s my v3.0 algorithm: Collect evidence, come up with small alternative models, and combine those into big models.</p>
<p>Mission: Collect 10 pieces of evidence.</p>
<p>Resource: The Will Power Instinct, by Kelly McGonigal</p>
<h1 id="chapter-five-the-brains-big-lie">Chapter Five: The Brain’s Big Lie</h1>
<p>What we do is caused by what feels like it promises a reward (aka what activates our dopamine system), not by what we think will give us rewards.</p>
<p>Key variables: what we do, whether we feel a promise of reward, whether we think it will give us a reward</p>
<h1 id="evidence">Evidence</h1>
<p>Intervention: Olds and the rat -&gt; it would do anything to get another shock</p>
<p>Intervention: shock before the rat got to the food (after being hungry) -&gt; would stop and never budge</p>
<p>Intervention: shocks -&gt; every five seconds; Even found self-torture acceptable if they got shocks; Even if they had to run across electrified grid.</p>
<p>Intervention: Permission to stimulate at any rate they liked -&gt; 40 shocks per minute</p>
<p>Intervention: food was brought in, hungry -&gt; didn’t want to stop</p>
<p>Correlation: They felt anxious, not happy</p>
<p>Hypothesis: stimulation -&gt; motivation, but not satisfaction</p>
<p>Hypothesis from neuroscience: Dopamine tells your brain what to pay attention to and what to do.</p>
<p>Intervention: Remove dopamine system -&gt; still happy when eating sugar; but won’t work for it.</p>
<p>Intervention: reward-promising symbol appeared -&gt; one area of the brain lit up; when money appeared -&gt; not this area, another area.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: Technology has an addictive effect on our brains (by giving us more jolts of dopamine).</p>
<p>Correlation (or intervention?): playing a video game leads to dopamine increases equivalent to using amphetamine use. (is that bad?)</p>
<p>Correlation: Parkinson’s disease - caused by the loss dopamine-producing brain cells. Symptoms: slow or impaired movement, depression, and occasionally complete catatonia.</p>
<p>Intervention: dopamine-enhancing drug -&gt; addictive behaviour; stop it -&gt; gone.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: one promise of reward -&gt; increased dopamine levels -&gt; more susceptible to any other kind of temptation.</p>
<p>Intervention: Erotic images make men more likely to take financial risks; fantasizing about winning the lottery makes people overeat.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: So, daydreaming about unattainable rewards can get you in trouble (by increasing your dopamine levels and making you susceptible to other temptations)</p>
<p>Question: What things evoke a promise of reward in our mind? Only stuff that promises immediate gratification?</p>
<p>Intervention: Food and drink samples make shoppers hungrier and thirstier and put shoppers in a reward-seeking state of mind.</p>
<p>Intervention: People who sampled something sweet were more likely to purchase indulgent foods as well as items on sale.</p>
<p>Intervention: Food and drink samples amplify the appeal of products that typically activate the reward system, but not on items that don’t.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: How much you feel something gives you the promise of reward depends on the total level of dopamine you’re feeling?? (But no, utilitarian items don’t get affected.) Or is that the amount of dopamine it generates by default gets multiplied by the existing dopamine level? She says that high levels of dopamine amplify the lure of immediate gratifications.</p>
<p>(Casual games probably do this - they might motivate you more (?).)</p>
<p>Correlation: 81% believed that the opposite would be true for the sample-eating shoppers. Most people also believe they’re immune to ads. But, ample evidence that TV ads for snack foods make you more likely to hit the fridge</p>
<p>Hypothesis: The reward system also responds to novelty and variety. It also depends on whether you feel like you’re getting a bargain. Scarcity increases reward responses.</p>
<p>Intervention: appetizing odour is one of the fastest ways to trigger the promise of reward.</p>
<p>Intervention: A little promise of reward can be a powerful antidote to anxiety.</p>
<p>Intervention: Fish bowl of lotteries after each drug test -&gt; stay for the whole treatment, pass all their drug tests, far less likely relapse. Crucially, this works even better than guaranteed rewards.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: our reward system gets much more excited about a possible big win than a guaranteed smaller reward.</p>
<p>Question: Is this why I’m so interested in making it big someday?</p>
<p>Hypothesis: dopamine triggers the release of stress hormones. The need to get what you want feels like a life-or-death emergency.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: You try to relieve your anxiety. Prediction: you feel relief.</p>
<p>Intervention: image of chocolate -&gt; startle response (correlated with alarm and arousal), pleasure and anxiety.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: We mistake the promise of reward for happiness. We find it nearly impossible to distinguish the promise of reward from the payoff we’re seeking.</p>
<p>Intervention: Stale popcorn + smell experiment -&gt; they ate it</p>
<p>Intervention: mindful eating -&gt; the food looks and smells better than it tastes; greater self-control around food. They lose weight and also experience less stress, anxiety, and depression.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: The thing we’re seeking happiness from is the main source of our misery.</p>
<p>Experiment: “Mindfully indulge, but don’t rush through the experience. Notice what the promise of reward feels like: the anticipation, the hope, the excitement, the anxiety, the salivation - whatever is going on in your brain and body. Then give yourself permission to give in. How does the experience compare with the expectation? Does the feeling of the promise of reward ever go away - or does it continue to drive you to eat more, spend more, or stay longer? When, if ever, do you become satisfied? Or do you simply reach the point of being unable to continue, because you’re stuffed, exhausted, frustrated, out of time, or out of the”reward“?”</p>
<p>Intervention: Adam -&gt; reduced oxygen to the brain -&gt; lesions in the brain’s reward system -&gt; loss of desire</p>
<p>Correlation: depressed people -&gt; reward system can’t sustain activation</p>
